<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> The story of "Goetz von Berlichingen" was founded on the
life of a German soldier of fortune who flourished between 1480
and 1562. The possibilities of his biography inspired Goethe (Vol.
IV, p. 253) with the idea of doing for Germany what Shakespeare
had done for mediæval England. In a few weeks he had turned
the life into a series of vivid dramatic pictures, which so engrossed
him that he "forgot Homer, Shakespeare, and everything."
For the next two years the manuscript lay untouched.
In 1773 he made a careful revision and published it anonymously
under the title of "Goetz von Berlichingen of the Iron Hand";
it is in this form we possess the work now. At a still later
period, in 1804, Goethe prepared another version of the play
for the stage. The subject-matter of "Goetz" is purely revolutionary.
Goetz, the hero himself, is a champion of a good cause&mdash;the
cause of freedom and self-reliance. He is the embodiment
of sturdy German virtues, the Empire and the Church playing
the unenviable role of intrigue and oppression. As a stage
play, "Goetz" is ill-constructed, but otherwise it stands a veritable
literary triumph, and a worthy predecessor to "Faust."
This epitome has been prepared from the German text.</p>

I hope, a blessing to myself and realm,<br />
To lead thee to my dwelling as my bride.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Iphigenia:</span> If I conceal'd, O king, my name, my race,<br />
It was embarrassment, and not mistrust.<br />
For didst thou know who stands before thee now,<br />

Thou wouldst more likely banish me forthwith.</p>

His son, Pelops, obtained his second wife<br />
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Through treachery and murder. And Hebe's sons,<br />
Thyestes and Atreus, envious of the love<br />
That Pelops bore his first-born, murdered him.<br />
The mother, held as murderess by the sire,<br />
In terror did destroy herself. The sons,<br />
After the death of Pelops, shared the rule<br />
O'er Mycenæ, till Atreus from the realm<br />
Thyestes drove. Oh, spare me to relate<br />

To him Electra, and to fill his cup<br />
Of bliss, Orestes. But misfortunes new<br />
Befel our ancient house, when to avenge<br />
The fairest woman's wrongs the kings of Greece<br />
Round Ilion's walls encamp'd, led by my sire.<br />
In Aulis vainly for a favouring gale<br />
They waited; for, enrag'd against their chief,<br />
Diana stay'd their progress, and requir'd,<br />
Through Chalcas' voice, the monarch's eldest daughter.<br />
They lured me to the altar, and this head<br />
There to the goddess doomed. She was appeased,<br />

From olden time no stranger near'd our shore<br />
But fell a victim at her sacred shrine;<br />
But thou, with kind affection didst enthral<br />
Me so that wholly I forgot my duty;<br />
And I did not hear my people's murmurs.<br />
Now they cry aloud. No longer now<br />
Will I oppose the wishes of the crowd.<br />
Two strangers, whom in caverns of the shore<br />
We found conceal'd, and whose arrival here<br />
Bodes to my realm no good, are in my power.<br />

<p><a name="Footnote_B_2" id="Footnote_B_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> Goethe's fascinating and noble drama, "Iphigenia in Tauris,"
was first written in prose, and recast into verse in 1786. Inspired
partly by his feelings towards Frau von Stein, whom
Goethe "credited with knowing every trait of his being," and
partly by the "Iphigenia in Tauris" of Euripides, the play is
totally different from anything that had as yet come from his
pen. Although it lacks some of the pomp and circumstance of
the best Greek tragedy, it is written with great dignity in the
strictest classical form, admirably suggesting the best in French
classical drama. The prominent motive of the piece is the struggle
between truth and falsehood. "It is," one critic has remarked,
"a poetic drama of the soul." On its production at
Weimar, the German public received it indifferently.</p>

received the letter from St. Petersburg, I ran out to tell
the postmaster what it had announced. On the way
Dobchinski pressed me to go into the inn for refreshment.
Into the restaurant came an elegant young man with a
fashionable aspect. The landlord told us he was an
official on his way from Petersburg to Saratov, and that
he is acting strangely, for he has been here more than a
fortnight, and pays for nothing.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Governor:</span> Good lord! Surely it cannot be he!
Been here a fortnight? May heaven help us. You, sirs,
get all your departments in proper trim. In the meantime
I will take a stroll round the town, and satisfy myself
that travellers are treated with due respect.</p>

mine has squandered all his money on the way, and here
we are penniless. The old man sends his son money, but
he goes on the racket with it till all is spent, and then he
has to pawn his clothes almost to the last rag. And now
this landlord declares he will let us have nothing more to
eat unless we pay in advance. Ah, there's the knock.</p>

him by profuse offers of hospitality and entertainment,
though when at first mention is made of taking him to other

at such a thing.</p>

<p class="font09 pmb1">Banging the table, Khelstakov declares he will <i>not</i> go to the
gaol, but will complain to the Minister of the Interior; and the
governor, trembling and terrified, pleads that he has a wife and
little children, and begs that he may not be ruined. The ridiculous
misunderstanding on both sides grows more confused every
minute. The governor pours forth the most abject apologies;
declares that if the people accuse him of oppression and extortion,
and even of flogging women, they are a slandering mob.</p>

quietly slips in 200 extra roubles. The governor, convinced that
the inspector-general is simply determined to keep up his <i>incognito</i>,
resolves to act accordingly, and to tell falsehoods appropriate
for mutual deception. He invites the guest to visit
Various institutions, and a round is made.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Governor:</span> In other towns I venture to say that the

aim at winning the approbation of the government.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Khelstakov:</span> That lunch was very good! The fish
was delicious! Where was it that we lunched? Was it
not at the hospital? I saw the beds, but there were not
many patients. Have the sick recovered?</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Governor:</span> Yes. Since I became governor they all
get well like flies, not so much by doctoring as by honesty
and regularity. Thank God, everything goes satisfactorily
here! Another governor would undoubtedly look
after his own advantage; but, believe me, when I lie down
to sleep, my prayer is, "O Thou my Lord, may the government
perceive my zeal and be satisfied." So I have
an easy conscience.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Khelstakov:</span> Are there any clubs here where a game
at cards could be had?</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Governor:</span> God forbid! Here such a thing as a card-club
is never heard of. I am disgusted at the sight of a
card, and never dealt one in my life. Once to amuse the
children I built a house of cards, and had accursed dreams
all night.</p>

connections. His house is the first in St. Petersburg. Meantime,
the various functionaries meet in the house of the governor
to concert measures for propitiating this great courtier. They
resolve to present him with a substantial token of regard. With
great trepidation they wait on him.</p>

me into exile.</p>

<p class="font09">Khelstakov picks up the notes, and asks that the money may
be lent him, as he has spent all his cash on the journey. He
promises to return it as soon as he reaches home, but the judge
protests that the honour of lending it is enough, and he begs
that there shall be no injunction against him.</p>

<p class="font09 pmb1">Next to present himself is the postmaster, in full uniform,
sword in hand. After a little conversation with this functionary,
Khlestakov thinks he may just as well borrow of him also, and
he forthwith mentions that a singular thing has happened to
him, for he has lost all his money on the way, and would be
glad to be obliged with the loan of three hundred roubles. It
is instantly counted out with alacrity, and the postmaster hastily
retires. Also, in a very nervous state, Luka, the School Director,
the Charity Commissioner, Bobchinski and Dobchinski, come to
pay their homage, and Khlestakov borrows easily from each in
turn.</p>

<div class="block2a">
<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Khelstakov</span> <i>(alone):</i> There are many officials here;
it seems to me, however, that they take me for a government
functionary. What fools! I must write about it
all to Tryapitchkin at Petersburg; he will write sketches
of it in the papers. Here, Osip, bring me paper and ink!
I will just see how much money I have got. Oh, more
than a thousand!</p>

<p class="font09 pmb1">While he is writing a letter Osip interrupts him with earnest
assurances that it will be prudent to depart speedily from the
town; for people have been mistaking him for somebody else,
and awkward complications may ensue. It is really time to go.
There are splendid horses here, and these can be secured for
the journey. Khlestakov consents, tells Osip to take the letter
to the post, and to obtain good posthorses. Suddenly some
merchants present themselves with petitions, bringing with them
gifts of sugar-loaves and wine. They pour forth bitter complaints
against the governor. They accuse him of constant and
outrageous extortion. They beg Khlestakov to secure his deposition
from office. When they offer the sugar-loaves and the
wine, Khlestakov protests that he cannot accept bribes, but if
they would offer him a loan of three hundred roubles that would
be another matter. They do so and go out.</p>

swears he is innocent of oppressing anybody.</p>

<p class="font09 pmb1">To his profound amazement, Anna informs her husband that

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_C_3" id="Footnote_C_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_C_3"><span class="label">[C]</span></a> Nicolai Vasilieyitch Gogol is famous not only as the prince
of Russian humorists, but as the real founder of both the modern
drama and the novel in Russian literature. He was born on
March 31, 1809, in the province of Poltava, in South, or "Little,"
Russia, and died at Moscow on March 3, 1852. His life was replete
with romantic episodes. After a short career on the stage,
in St. Petersburg, followed by the tenure of a minor Government
office, he returned to the South, and at once found his true vocation
and achieved a wide popularity by a collection of stories
and sketches of Cossack life, entitled "Evenings at a Farm
House," which appeared in 1830. Other "Cossack Tales" rapidly
followed, including the famous "Taras Bulba"; in recognition
of which, and of his project for writing a history of Russia in
the Middle Ages, he was rewarded with a chair of history at
St. Petersburg. This he held but for a short time, however.
Turning his attention to comedy, Gogol now produced the drama
"The Inspector-General" ("Revizor") in 1836, the play achieving
a tremendous success on the stage in the spring of the same
year, whilst in 1842 his novel entitled "Dead Souls" embodied
the fruits of the same idea in fiction. The play is intended to
bring a scathing indictment against the corruptions and abuses
of officialism and administration. The following epitome has
been prepared from the original Russian.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_D_4" id="Footnote_D_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_D_4"><span class="label">[D]</span></a> The Life of Goldsmith, by John Forster, may be found in
Volume IX of the <span class="smcap">World's Greatest Books</span> (see also Vol. IV,
p. 275). "The Mistakes of a Night, or She Stoops to Conquer,"
appeared at Covent Garden, in March, 1773. So convinced was
George Colman that the public would endure nothing but sentiment,
that he could hardly be induced to accept the play, and was
extremely nervous about its success, almost until the fall of the
curtain on the first night. Nevertheless, its success was immediate
and decisive, and it became established as a stock piece.
The play loses nothing by the suppression of sentimental passages
between Hastings and Miss Neville, without which Colman would
certainly have declined it altogether. Apart from the main
argument&mdash;the wooing of Kate Hardcastle&mdash;the plot turns on
the points that Tony Lumpkin is the son of Mrs. Hardcastle by
her first marriage, and that Constance Neville is her niece and
ward, not her husband's.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_E_5" id="Footnote_E_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_E_5"><span class="label">[E]</span></a> Heinrich Heine was born on December 13, 1797, at Düsseldorf,
the son of Jewish parents. After quitting school he was
sent to Frankfort to the banking establishment of an uncle, but
a commercial career failed to appeal to him, and in 1819 he
entered the University of Bonn, with a view of studying for
law. His thoughts, however, were given to poetry; and 1822
saw the publication of his first volume of poems. Up to this
time he was largely dependent upon the generosity of his uncle.
Thus, in order to fulfil his obligations, he entered the University
of Göttingen, where he obtained his degree of law, having
previously qualified himself for practice by renouncing the
Jewish faith for Christianity. A voluminous prose-writer, a
wonderful satirist, and an ardent politician, Heine's present-day
fame rests largely on his poetry, and especially the wonderful
lyrical pieces. "Atta Troll" (1846), which has been described
as the "Swan-song of Romanticism," was written in the hey-day
of his activities, and admirably conveys something of the temper
and genius of its many-sided author. Heine died on February
17. 1856.</p></div></div>

<p class="font09 pmb1">To appease Phoebus, Agamemnon restored the captive daughter
of the sun-god's priest, allotted to him for spoil; but took
Briseis from Achilles to replace her. Achilles vowed to render
no more aid to the Greeks, telling his mother, the sea-nymph
Thetis, what had befallen, calling on Jove to aid his vengeance.</p>

<p class="font09 pmb1">To satisfy Thetis, Jupiter sent a false dream to Agamemnon,
the king of men, persuading him that Troy should now fall to his
attack. Beguiled by the dream, Agamemnon set forth in battle
array the whole Greek host, save that Achilles and his followers
were absent. And the whole host of Troy came forth to meet
them. Then Menelaus challenged Paris to single combat; for
the twain were the cause of the war, seeing that Paris had stolen
away Helen, the wife of Menelaus. Truce was struck while the
combat should take place. Paris hurled his javelin, but did not
pierce his foe's shield; Menelaus, having called on Jove,</p>

<span class="i0">This taint he followed with his sword, drawn from a silver sheath,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">On which it piecemeal brake, and fell from his unhappy hand ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Lo, now my lance hath missed his end, my sword in shivers flew,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With thought to drag him to the Greeks; which he had surely done,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And so, besides the victory, had wondrous glory won.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To force the life-blood of his foe, and ran on him amain,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With ease, and wondrous suddenly; for she, a goddess, might.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She hid him in a cloud of gold, and never made him known<br /></span>

<p class="font09 pmb1">Thereupon the truce was treacherously broken by Pandarus,
who, incited by Minerva, wounded Menelaus with an arrow; and
the armies closed with each other. Great deeds were done by

<h3>II.&mdash;<i>Of the Battle by the Ships</i></h3>

<blockquote>
<p class="font09 pmb1">After this, Hector fought with Ajax, and neither had the
better. And after that the Greeks set a rampart and a ditch
about their ships. Also, Agamemnon would have bidden the
Greeks depart altogether, but Diomedes withstood him. And in
the fighting that followed, Agamemnon showed himself the best
man among the Greeks, seeing that neither Achilles nor Diomedes
joined the fray; and the Trojans had the better, driving the
Greeks back to the rampart, and bursting through, so that they
were like to have burnt the Greek ships where they lay, led on
by Hector. To and fro swayed the tide of battle; for while Jove
slept, Neptune and Juno gave force and courage to the Greeks,
and the Trojans were borne back; Hector being sore hurt with
a stone cast by Ajax. But Jove, awaking, restored Hector's
strength, sending Apollo to him. Then Apollo and Hector led</p>

through from behind, and Hector slew him. Ajax and Menelaus
came to rescue Patroclus' body; Hector fled, but had already
stripped off the armour of Achilles, which he now put on in
place of his own. Again the battle waxed furious about the
dead Patroclus until Menelaus and Meriones bore the corpse

Achilles against Agamemnon was assuaged; and they two were
reconciled at a gathering of the chiefs. And when by the counsel

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_F_6" id="Footnote_F_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_F_6"><span class="label">[F]</span></a> Of the personality of Homer, the maker of the "Iliad" and
the "Odyssey," those great epic poems which were the common
heritage of all Greeks, we have no knowledge. Tradition pictures
him as blind and old. Seven cities claimed to be his
birthplace. Probably he lived in the ninth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, since
the particular stages of social life which he portrays probably
belong to that era. Beyond this, all is conjecture. The poems
were not written down till a later date, when their authorship
was already a matter of tradition; and when what we may call
the canon of the text of the epics was laid down in the sixth
century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, it may be readily supposed that they were not in
the exact form which the master-poet himself had given them.
Hence the ingenuity of the modern commentator has endeavoured
to resolve Homer into an indefinite number of ballad-mongers,
whose ballads were edited into their existing unity.
On the whole, this view may be called Teutonic. Of the "Iliad,"
it suffices to say that it relates events immediately preceding
the fall of Troy, at the close of the tenth year of the siege
undertaken by the Greeks on account of the abduction of Helen
from Menelaus by Paris. Of Chapman's translation we shall
speak in the introduction to the "Odyssey."</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_G_7" id="Footnote_G_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_G_7"><span class="label">[G]</span></a> Of the "Odyssey" it may be said with certainty that its
composition was later than that of the "Iliad," but it cannot
be affirmed that both poems were not composed within the life-time
of one man. It may be claimed that the best criticism
declines to reject the identity of authorship of the poet of the
"Iliad" and the poet of the "Odyssey," while admitting the
probability that the work of other poets was incorporated in
his. We have given our readers the translation by George Chapman,
Shakespeare's contemporary, with which may be compared
the fine modern prose translation by Professor Butcher and Mr.
Andrew Lang. On the other hand, Alexander Pope's verse rendering
has nothing Homeric about it. It may be regretted that
Chapman did not in the "Odyssey" retain the swinging metre
which he used in the "Iliad." The poem relates the adventures
of Odysseus (latinised into Ulysses) on his homeward voyages,
after the fall of Troy.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_H_8" id="Footnote_H_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_H_8"><span class="label">[H]</span></a> Horace (Q. Horatius Flaccus), who was born near Venusia,
in Apulia, in 65 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and died in 8 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, was a southern Italian.
When twenty, Horace was a student of philosophy at Athens.
A period of poverty-stricken Bohemianism followed his return
to Rome, till acquaintance with Virgil opened a path into the
circle of Mæcenas and of the emperor. His literary career falls
into three divisions&mdash;that of his "Epodes" and "Satires," down
to 30 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>; that of his lyrics, down to 23 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, when the first three
books of the "Odes" appeared; and that of the reflective and
literary "Epistles," which include the famous "Art of Poetry,"
and, with sundry official odes, belong to his later years. Horatian
"satire," it should be observed, does not imply ferocious
personal onslaughts, but a miscellany containing good-humoured
ridicule of types, and lively sketches of character and incident.
So varied a performance as satirist, lyrist, moralist and critic,
coupled with his vivid interest in mankind, help to account for
the appeal which Horace has made to all epochs, countries, and
ranks. Of the translations of Horace here given, some are by
Prof. Wight Duff, and have been specially made for this
selection, whilst a few are by Milton, Dryden, Cowper, and
Francis.</p></div></div>

<span class="i0">When I would write with elegance and ease.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aiming at greatness, some to fustian soar:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some, bent on safety, creep along the shore.<br /></span>

<p><a name="Footnote_I_9" id="Footnote_I_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_I_9"><span class="label">[I]</span></a> Victor Hugo (see Vol. V, p. 122) occupies an anomalous
position among the great dramatists of the world. He is really a poet
with a splendid lyrical inspiration; but he combines this in his plays
with an acquired but effective talent for stage-craft. "Hernani" is the
most famous play in the European literature of the nineteenth century.
This is partly due to the fact that it was the first great romantic
drama given on the French stage. When it was produced, on February 25,
1830, there was a fierce battle in the theatre between the followers
of the new movement and the adherents of the classic school of French
playwriting. Little of the play itself was heard on the first night.
The voices of the players were drowned in a storm of denunciations
from the classicists, and counter-cheers from the romanticists. The
admirers of Victor Hugo won. "Hernani" is certainly the most romantic
of romantic dramas. The plot is striking, and full of swift and
astonishing changes, but the characters are not always true to life.
Nevertheless, "Hernani" is a fine, interesting, poetic melodrama, with
a rather weak last act. The gloomy scene with which it closes lacks
the inevitability of true tragedy. Had the play ended happily it would
undoubtedly have retained its popularity.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_J_10" id="Footnote_J_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_J_10"><span class="label">[J]</span></a> Victor Hugo wrote "Marion de Lorme" in 1829, three months
before he composed "Hernani." King Charles X., however,
refused to license the play, because of the terrible way in which
his ancestor, Louis XIII., was portrayed in it. But after the
Revolution of 1830, and the success of "Hernani," the forbidden
drama was produced on the stage. Its original title was "A
Duel Under Richelieu." The whole play is built around the
frustrated duel in which two young men engage against the
edict of the great cardinal. This economy of stage-craft makes
"Marion de Lorme" a superior work, in point of construction,
to "Hernani." And though it may be less picturesque than that
more famous example of the romantic drama, it is on the whole
a finer effort of genius.</p>

Ignorant of our ways, who has no fear<br />
Because she has no knowledge. Had she guessed<br />
I had so many weapons of revenge<br />

She would have been more careful. Poisoning,<br />

Of course, is easy; and when she was dead<br />
I could retrieve the power that I have lost.<br />
But I would rather crush and conquer her<br />
Some other way; make her a very slave<br />

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_K_11" id="Footnote_K_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_K_11"><span class="label">[K]</span></a> In appearance, "Ruy Blas" is a pendant to "Hernani." In
the earlier play, Victor Hugo gives a striking picture of the
Spanish nobility in the days of its power and splendour. In the
later drama, which he composed in 1838, he depicts in lurid
light the corruption into which that nobility afterwards fell.
But, as a matter of fact, "Ruy Blas" is a violent party pamphlet
with a direct bearing on the French politics of the thirties.
It is the decadent French nobility&mdash;vanquished in the revolution
of 1830&mdash;that Hugo really attacks; and Ruy Blas himself
is a representative Frenchman of the era of romanticism. Stendhal
(Vol. VIII) was the first writer to study this new type of
character&mdash;the young man of the lower middle classes, full of
grandiose dreams and wild ambitions and strange weaknesses,
who thought to arrive by intrigue at the high position which
the great soldiers of the preceding generation had won on the
battlefield. Balzac (Vol. I) elaborated the character in his "Human
Comedy"; and Hugo, by ennobling and enlarging it, created
the sombre, magnificent figure of Ruy Blas.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_L_12" id="Footnote_L_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_L_12"><span class="label">[L]</span></a> Victor Hugo was a man with a remarkable aptitude for divining
the real course of popular feeling and giving violent expression
to it. It was this that made him one of the leaders
of the modern republican movement in France. Precluded by
his earlier works from attacking the monarchy openly, he set
about discrediting it by a series of historical plays in which the
French kings were depicted in a sinister light. In "Marion de
Lorme" he holds up the weakest of the Bourbons to bitter
contempt; in "The King Amuses Himself" ("Le roi s'amuse"),
produced in 1832, he satirises the most brilliant of the
Valois&mdash;François I. The portrait is a clever but one-sided piece of
work; it is based on facts; but not on all the facts. It is true
that François used to frequent low taverns and mix in disreputable
company, but he was also the most chivalrous king
of his age, and a man of fine tastes in art and letters. Nevertheless,
the play is one of the best of Victor Hugo's by reason
of the strange and terrible character of the king's jester,
Triboulet. This ugly little hunchback is surely a memorable
figure in literature. The horror and pity which he excites as
he sits by the river in the storm and darkness, rejoicing in the
consummation of his scheme of revenge, have something of that
awfulness which is the note of veritable tragedy. The scene is
a superb example of dramatic irony.</p>

<span class="i0">Cain, flying from the presence of the Lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came through the tempest to a mountain land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And being worn and weary with the flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His wife and children cried to him, and said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Here let us rest upon the earth and sleep."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, folded in the skin of beasts, they slept.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But no sleep fell on Cain; he raised his head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saw, amid the shadows of the night,<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
<span class="i0">An eye in heaven sternly fixed on him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I am too near," he said, with trembling voice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rousing his weary children and worn wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He fled again along the wilderness.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For thirty days and thirty nights he fled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silent and pale, and shuddering at a sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He walked with downcast eyes, and never turned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To look behind him. On the thirtieth day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He came unto the shore of a great sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Here we will live," he said. "Here we are safe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here on the lonely frontier of the world!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, sitting down, he gazed across the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there, on the horizon, was the eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still fixed on him. He leaped up, wild with fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crying, "Oh, hide me! Hide me!" to his sons.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Jabal, the tent-maker, sheltered him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within his tent, and fastened down with stones<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flapping skins. But Cain still saw the eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burning upon him through the leathern tent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Enoch said, "Come, let us build with stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A city with a wall and citadel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hide our father there, and close the gates."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Tubalcain, the great artificer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quarried the granite, and with iron bands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bound the huge blocks together, and he made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A city, with a rampart like a hill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Encircling it, and towers that threw a shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Longer than any mountain's on the plain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep in the highest and the strongest tower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cain was enclosed. "Can the eye see you now?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His children asked him. "Yes, it is fixed on me,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He answered. And with haggard face he crept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the tower, and cried unto his sons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I will go down into the earth, and live<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone, within a dark and silent tomb.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No one shall ever see my face again,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When John the Striker, lord of Lusace, died,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaving his kingdom to his gentle niece,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mahaud, great joy there was in all the land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For she was beautiful, and sweet and young,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kind to the people, and beloved by them.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Sigismund, the German emperor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Ladislas of Poland were not glad.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long had they coveted the wide domains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of John the Striker; and Eviradnus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tall, white-haired Alastian warrior,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Home from his battles in the Holy Land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard, as he wandered through the castle grounds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strange talk between two strangers&mdash;a lute-player<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And troubadour&mdash;who with their minstrelsy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had charmed the lovely lady of Lusace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she was taking them with her that night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Corbus Castle&mdash;an old ruined keep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From which her race was sprung. Ere she was crowned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An ancient custom of the land required<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mahaud to pass the night in solitude<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Corbus, where her ancestors reposed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the silence of the wooded hills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On which the stronghold stands. Being afraid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the ordeal, Mahaud took with her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The two strange minstrels, so that they might make<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Music and mirth until she fell asleep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An old priest, cunning in the use of herbs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came with her to the border of the wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gave her a mysterious wine to drink<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
<span class="i0">To make her slumber till the break of day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When all the people of Lusace would come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wake her with their shouts, and lead her forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the cathedral where she would be crowned.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">To enter Corbus on this solemn night,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Did not fear death. Opening the castle gate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He strode into the chamber where Mahaud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would have to pass the night. Two long, dim lines<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of armed and mounted warriors filled the hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each with his lance couched ready for the shock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sternly silent. Empty panoplies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They were, in which the lords of old Lusace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had lived and fought and died, since the red days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Attila, from whom their race was sprung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swept over Europe. Now, on effigies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the great war-horses they loved and rode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their armoured image sat; and eyeless holes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gaped in their visors, black and terrible.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seizing the leader of this spectral host,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eviradnus dragged his clanging body down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hid it; and then leaped upon the horse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with closed visor, motionless mail and lance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clenched in his gauntlet, he appeared transformed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into an iron statue, like the rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As through the open window came the sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of lute-playing and laughter, and a song<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sung by the troubadour, rang righ and clear:</span>

<span class="i0">"Look!" cried Mahaud, as she came in the hall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the two minstrels. "It is terrible!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sooner would I have lost my crown than come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone at midnight to this dreadful place."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Does this old iron," said the troubadour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Striking the armour of Eviradnus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Frighten you?" "Leave my ancestors in peace!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exclaimed Mahaud. "A little man like you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must not lay hands on them." The troubadour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grew pale with anger, but the tall lute-player<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laughed, and his blue eyes flamed upon Mahaud.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Now I must sleep," she said, "the priest's strange wine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Begins to make me drowsy. Stay with me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stay and watch over me all night, my friends."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Far have we travelled," said the troubadour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"In hopes to be alone with you to-night."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his dark face lightened with a grim smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, as he spoke, Mahaud fell fast asleep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I'll take the girl," he cried to the lute-player,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And you can have the land! Are you content?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Yes," said the lute-player, "but love is sweet."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Revenge is sweeter!" cried the troubadour.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"'A little man like me!' Those were her words.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Neither as queen nor empress shall she reign!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I swore it when she flouted me. She dies!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I cannot kill her," said the lute-player,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I love her." "So do I!" the other said.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"I love her and hate her. If she lived,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There would be war between us two. She dies!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We love her; we must kill her." As he spoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The troubadour pulled at a ring, and raised<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A flagstone in the floor. "I know this place,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said. "A lord of Lusace had this trap<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made for his enemies. 'Twill serve our need!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Help me to lift her. All the land is yours."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Look!" screamed the lute-player. "Oh, God! Oh, God!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The troubadour turned round, and his knees shook.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One of the iron images had leapt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down from its lifeless horse, and with drawn sword<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clank of armour, it now drove at them.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"King Ladislas and Emperor Sigismund!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It shouted in a terrible voice that fell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon them like a judgment from on high.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They grovelled at its iron feet, and shrieked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Mercy! Oh, mercy!" And Eviradnus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doffing his helmet and cuirass, exclaimed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I am a man and not an iron ghost!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It sickens me to see such cowardice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the two greatest conquerors of the age.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look! I have taken all my armour off;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meet me like men, and use what arms you will."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"'Tis only an old man," said Ladislas.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Hold him in front, while I strike from behind."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eviradnus laid down his sword, to loose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The last piece of his armour, and the Pole<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ran at him with a dagger; with one hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old man gripped the little king, and shook<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The life out of him. Then, as Sigismund<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Snatched up his sword, and left him still unarmed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eviradnus stooped, and, seizing the dead king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He whirled him by the feet, like a huge club.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stricken with terror, Sigismund recoiled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the open trap. Eviradnus<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Flung his strange weapon after him, and they fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The living emperor, and the lifeless king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the dark abyss. Closing the stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eviradnus put on his mail, and set<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hall in order. And when he had placed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The iron image on its horse, the dawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gleamed through the windows, and the noise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And murmur of the people of Lusace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Coming with branches of green broom to greet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their lady, filled the air. Mahaud awoke.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Where is my troubadour and lute-player?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She said. Eviradnus bent over her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His old grey eyes shining with tenderness.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Lady," he said, "I hope that you slept well?"<br /></span>

<h3><i>The Temple of the Captives</i></h3>

<div class="block3">

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The high-priest said unto the King of Kings:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"We need a temple to commemorate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your glorious victories." The King of Kings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Called unto him the captives he had made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bade them build the temple, and he asked:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Is there a man among you who can plan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And raise this monument unto my fame?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"No," said they. "Kill a hundred of these slaves!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The King of Kings exclaimed. And this was done.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One of the captives promised then to build<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A temple on the mountain looking down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the city of the King of Kings.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loaded with chains, the prisoners were dragged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the streets and up the mountain track,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there they toiled with grim and angry eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cutting a building in the solid rock.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"'Tis but a cavern!" said the King of Kings.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"We found a lion's lair," the captive said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And fashioned it into your monument.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Enter, O King of Kings, and see the work<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your slaves have built for you!" The conqueror<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And captive entered. To a royal throne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The King of Kings was led, that he might view<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The temple; and the builder flung himself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Face downwards at his feet. Then, suddenly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The throne began to sink below the floor.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Where are we going?" said the King of Kings.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Down the deep pit into the inner hall!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The captive said. A sound like thunder rang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above them, and the King of Kings exclaimed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What noise was that?" "The block of stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That covers in this pit," the captive said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Has fallen in its place!" The King of Kings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Groped in the darkness, and with trembling voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He asked: "Is there no way out of this pit?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Surely," the captive said, "the King of Kings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose hands are swift like lightning, and whose feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tread down all nations, can find out a way?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"There is no light, no sound, no breath of air!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cried out the King of Kings. "Why is it dark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cold within the temple to my fame?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Because," the captive said, "it is your tomb!"<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In wild disorder. Over a bare plain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And up a hill, swept by the guns of France,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They ran, and reached the shelter of a wood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There they re-formed&mdash;the peasant royalists.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then Jean Chouan, who was leading them,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A tall, wild figure, with his long, loose hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Streaming upon the wind. And suddenly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A cry rang shrill and keen above the roar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the French guns. A woman's cry it was;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, looking from the hill, Jean Chouan saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A woman labouring, with bare, torn feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And haggard, terror-stricken face, to reach<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A refuge in the forest. Up the hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swep by the French artillery, she toiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the shells burst around her. "She is lost!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jean Chouan murmured. "She will be destroyed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before she reaches shelter. Oh, the brutes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To mass their fire upon a woman's head!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<hr class="tb" />
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Then on the height that overlooked the plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jean Chouan sprang, and stood against the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fearless and proud, superb and motionless,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cried, "I am Jean Chouan!" The French troops<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gazed for a moment in astonishment<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At his tall figure. "Yes, it is the chief!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They said to one another, as they turned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their guns upon him. "Save yourself!" he cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"My sister, save yourself!" as, mad with fright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The woman stumbled onward. Like a pine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too strongly rooted in the rock to bend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or break beneath the fury of the storm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He towered amid the hurricane of death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That roared and flamed around him. "I will wait<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until you gain the forest!" he exclaimed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The woman hastened. Over the hill she crept,<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And staggered down the valley. "Is she safe?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jean Chouan shouted, as a bullet passed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Right through his body. Standing still erect,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He waited, with a smile upon his lips,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The answer. When some voices in the wood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cried, "Jeanne is safe. Return!" Jean Chouan said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Ave Maria!" and then fell down dead.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Kill him!" the mob yelled. "Kill him!" as they surged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In fury round their prisoner. Unmoved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And unafraid he stood: a constable<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Paris, captured by the Communards.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hands were black with gunpowder; his clothes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were red with blood. A simple, fearless man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Charged with the task of carrying out the law,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He gave no quarter, and he asked for none.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the day he had fought against the mob<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That swept with sword and flame along the streets<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Paris, while the German conqueror<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Battened on France. A woman sprang at him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shrieked, "You have been killing us!" "That's true,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The man replied. "Come, shoot him here!" she screamed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"No! Farther on! At the Bastille!" "No! Here!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And while the crowd disputed, the man said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Kill me just where you like; but kill me quick."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Yes!" cried the woman, "shoot him where he stands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He is a wolf!" "A wolf that has been caught,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The prisoner said, "by a vile pack of curs!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The wretch insults us!" yelled the furious mob.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Down with him! Death! Death! Death!" And with clenched fists<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
<span class="i0">They struck him on the face. An angry flame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gleamed in his eyes, but, silent and superb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He marched along the street amid the howls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the ferocious, maddened multitude!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God! How they hated him! To shoot him seemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too light a sentence, as he calmly strode<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the corpses of their comrades strewn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the street. "How many did you kill?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They shrieked at him. "Murderer! Traitor! Spy!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He did not answer; but the waiting mob<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard a small voice cry: "Daddy!" and a child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of six years' age ran from a house close by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And struggled to remain and clasped his knees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saying, "He is my daddy. Don't hurt him!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He is my daddy&mdash;" "Down with the cursed spy!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shoot him at once!" a hundred voices said;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Then we can get on with our work!" Their yells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The clangour of the tocsin, and the roar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of cannon mingled. 'Mid the dreadful noise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The child, still clinging to his father's knees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cried, "I tell you he's my daddy. Let him go!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pale, tearful, with one arm thrown out to shield<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His father, and the other round his leg,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The child stood. "He is pretty!" said a girl.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"How old are you, my little one?" The child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Answered, "Don't kill my daddy!" Many men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lowered their eyes, and the fierce hands that gripped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The prisoner began to loose their hold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Send the kid to its mother!" one man cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And end this job!" "His mother died last month,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The prisoner said. "Do you know Catherine?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He asked his little boy. "Yes," said the child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"She lives next door to us." "Then go to her,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said, in grave, calm, kindly tones. "No! No!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I cannot go without you!" cried his son.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"They're going to hurt you, daddy, all these men!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The father whispered to the Communards<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
<span class="i0">That held him. "Let me say good-bye to him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you can shoot me round the corner-house;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or where you will!" They loosed their prisoner<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A moment, and he said unto his child:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"You see, we're only playing. They are friends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I am going for a walk with them.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be a good boy, my darling, and run home."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Raising his face up to be kissed, the child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smiled through his tears, and skipped into the house.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Now," said his father to the silent mob,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Where would you like to shoot me; by this wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or round the corner?" Through the crowd of men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mad with the lust for blood, a shudder passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with one voice they cried: "Go home! Go home!"<br /></span>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_M_13" id="Footnote_M_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_M_13"><span class="label">[M]</span></a> English poetry of the last eighty years is fine in quality and
great in volume, but it would be difficult to maintain that it is
the finest and greatest poetry of the period. It was France
that produced the master-singer, and with rare generosity both
Tennyson and Swinburne acknowledged that Victor Hugo was
their superior. The range of power of the Frenchman was
marvellous; he was a great novelist, a great playwright, a great
political writer; but, above all, he was a poet. His immense
force of imagination and narrative power is displayed at its
best in "The Legend of the Ages" ("La Légende des Siécles").
The first part appeared in 1859, the second in 1877, and the last
in 1883. It consists of a series of historical and philosophic
poems, in which the story of the human race is depicted in the
lightning flashes of a resplendent imagination. Some of the
poems, given here for the first time in English, contain stories
as fine as the masterpieces of the great novelists.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Solness:</span> Oh, he's not bad, for my purpose.</p>

(<i>Calling her to the window</i>) Look over there; that's

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Solness:</span> Three&mdash;as there are here. But there will
never be any child in them. We have had children,
Aline and I, but we didn't keep them long, our two
little boys. The fright Aline got when our old house
was burnt down affected her health, and she failed to
rear them. Yet that fire made me. I built no more
churches; but cosy, comfortable homes for human beings.
But my position as an artist has been paid for in Aline's
happiness. I could have prevented that fire by seeing to
a flue. But I didn't. And yet the flue didn't actually
cause the fire. Yet it was my fault in a certain sense.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Hilda:</span> I'm afraid you must be&mdash;ill.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Hilda</span> (<i>when</i> <span class="smcap">Ragnar</span> <i>has gone</i>): That was horribly
ugly&mdash;and hard and bad and cruel as well.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Solness:</span> Oh, you don't understand my position,
which I've paid so dear for. <i>(Confidentially)</i> Hilda,
don't you agree with me that there exists special chosen
people, who have the power of desiring, <i>craving</i> a thing,
until at last it <i>has</i> to happen? And aren't there helpers
and servers who must do their part too? But they never
come of themselves. One has to call them very persistently,
inwardly. So the fire happened conveniently
for me; but the two little boys and Aline were sacrificed.
She will never be the woman she longed to be.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Hilda:</span> I believe you have a sickly conscience. I

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Hilda:</span> I think it is.</p>

And the women they used to carry off had robust consciences,
too. They often wouldn't leave their captors

little children! Then, that day, I did the impossible. I
was able to climb up to a great height. As I stood hanging
the wreath on the vane, I cried, "O Mighty One, I

<p><a name="Footnote_N_14" id="Footnote_N_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_N_14"><span class="label">[N]</span></a> Henrik Ibsen, poet and the creator of a new type of drama, was
born at Skien, in South Norway, on March 20, 1828. Apprenticed
first to a chemist at Grimstad, he next entered Christiania
University, but speedily wearied of regular academic studies. He
then undertook journalistic work for two years, and afterwards
became a theatrical manager at Bergen. In 1857 he was appointed
director of the National Theatre at Christiania, and about
this time wrote, at intervals, plays in the style of the ancient
Norse sagas. "The Master Builder" ("Bygmester Solness")
belongs to his later efforts, and was completed in 1892. In it
many critics discern the highest attainments of Ibsen's genius,
and its realism is strangely combined with romance. It is a
plea for the freedom of the human spirit; and the terrible drama
is wrought out in language of extraordinary symbolism. Hilda
Wangel is the "superwoman," who will suffer nothing to stand
between her and the realisation of herself. Had Solness been as
strong a spirit, the end might have been different. But he has a
"sickly conscience," unable to bear the heights of freedom. Here
again Ibsen is unique in his estimate of mankind. Nevertheless,
his characters are all actual personalities, and live vividly. Ibsen
died on May 23, 1906.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rummel:</span> Last year we narrowly escaped the
introduction of a railroad.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bernick:</span> My husband managed to block the
scheme, but the papers, in consequence, said shameful
things about him. But we are forgetting, dear rector,
that we have to thank you for devoting so much time
to us.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Rörlund:</span> Do you not all make sacrifices in a good

ladies! Well, you know Bernick has called a cabinet
council about this railway nonsense again. When it is a
question of money, then everything here ends in paltry
material calculations.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bernick:</span> But at any rate things are better than
formerly, when everything ended in dissipation.

<span class="smcap">Mrs. Rummel:</span> Only think of fifteen years ago.
What a life, with the dancing club and music club! I
well remember the noisy gaiety among families.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lynge:</span> There was a company of strolling players,
who, I was told, played many pranks. What was
the truth of the matter?</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="font09">Mrs. Rummel, when Dina is out of the room, explains to the
ladies that the girl is the daughter of a strolling player who years
before had come to perform for a season in the town. Dorf,
the actor, had deserted both wife and child, and the wife had to
take to work to which she was unaccustomed, was seized with
a pulmonary malady, and died. Then Dina had been adopted
by the Bernicks.</p>

<p class="font09 pmb3">Mrs. Rummel goes on to explain that at that season also
Johan, Mrs. Bernick's brother, had run away to America. After
his departure it was discovered that he had been playing tricks
with the cash-box of the firm, of which his widowed mother had
become the head. Karsten, now Consul, Bernick had just come
home from Paris. He became engaged to Betty Tönnesen, now
his wife, but when he entered her aunt's room, with the girl on
his arm, to announce his betrothal, Lona Hessel rose from her
chair and violently boxed his ear. Then she packed her box,
and went off to America. Little had been heard of Lona, except
that she had in America sung in taverns, and had given
lectures, and had written a most sensational book.</p>

<div class="block2a">

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Bernick:</span> I am not at all pleased, Aune, with the way
things are going on in the yard. The repairs are slow.
The <i>Palm Tree</i> should long since have been at sea.
That American ship, the <i>Indian Girl</i>, has been lying here
five weeks. You do not know how to use the new machines,
or else you will not use them.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Aune:</span> Consul, the <i>Palm Tree</i> can go to sea in two
days, but the <i>Indian Girl</i> is as rotten as matchwood in
the bottom planking. Now, I am getting on for sixty,
and I cannot take to new ways. I am afraid for the
many folk whom the machinery will deprive of a livelihood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Bernick:</span> I did not send for you to argue. Listen
now. The <i>Indian Girl</i> must be got ready to sail in two
days, at the same time as our own ship. There are reasons
for this decision. The carping newspaper critics
are pretending that we are giving all our attention to the
<i>Palm Tree</i>. If you will not do what I order, I must
look for somebody who will.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Aune:</span> You are asking impossibilities, consul. But
surely you cannot think of dismissing me, whose father
and grandfather worked here all their lives before me.
Do you know what is meant by the dismissal of an old
workman?</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Bernick:</span> You are a stubborn fellow, Aune. You
oppose me from perversity. I am sorry indeed if we
must part, Aune.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Aune:</span> We will not part, consul. The <i>Indian Girl</i>
shall be cleared in two days.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Hilmar:</span> Good-day, Betty! Good-day, Bernick.
Have you heard the new sensation? The two Americans
are going about the streets in company with Dina Dorf.
The town is all excitement about it.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Bernick</span> (<i>looking out into the street</i>): They are
coming here. We must be sure to treat them well.
They will soon be away again.</p>

<p class="ij4">[<span class="smcap">Johan</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lona</span> <i>enter. Presently all disperse into
the garden, and</i> <span class="smcap">Bernick</span> <i>goes up to</i> <span class="smcap">Johan</span>.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Bernick:</span> Now we are alone, Johan, I must thank
you. For to you I owe home, happiness, position, and
all that I have and am. Not one in ten thousand would
have done all that you then did for me. I was the guilty
one. On the night when that drunken wretch came home
it was for Betty's sake that I broke off the entanglement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
with Madame Dorf; but still, that you should act in such
a noble spirit of self-sacrifice as to turn appearances
against yourself, and go away, can never be forgotten
by me.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Johan:</span> Oh, well, we were both young and thoughtless.
I was an orphan, alone and free, and was glad to get
away from office drudgery. You had your old mother
alive, and you had just engaged yourself to Betty, who
was very fond of you. We agreed that you must be
saved, and I was proud to be your friend. You had
come back like a prince from abroad, and chose me for
your closest friend. Now I know why. You were
making love to Betty. But I was proud of it.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Bernick:</span> Are you going back to your American
farm? Not soon, I hope.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Johan:</span> As soon as possible. I only came over to
please Lona. She felt homesick. You can never think
what she has been to me. You never could tolerate her,
but to me she has been a mother, singing, lecturing, writing
to support me when I was ill and could not work.
And I may as well tell you frankly that I have told her
all. But do not fear her. She will say nothing. But
who would have dreamt of your taking into your house
that little creature who played angels in the theatre, and
scampered about here? What became of her parents?</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Bernick:</span> I wrote you all that happened. The
drunken scoundrel, after leaving his wife, was killed in
a drinking bout. After the wife died it was through
Martha that we took little Dina in charge.</p>
</div>

<blockquote>
<p class="font09 pmb3">To the amazement of the Bernicks and some others, Johan
makes it known that he has asked Dina to be his wife, and that
she has consented. To their further astonishment and annoyance,
Lona declares her profound approval of this engagement.
Moreover, Lona now challenges Bernick to clear his soul of the
lie on which he has stood for these fifteen years. It is a three-fold
lie&mdash;the lie towards Lona, then the lie towards Betty, then
the lie towards Johan. But Bernick shrinks from the terrible
shame that would come on him as one of the "pillars of society."</p>

<div class="block2a">

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Krap:</span> The <i>Palm Tree</i> can sail to-morrow, but as for
the <i>Indian Girl</i>, in my opinion she will not get far. I
have been secretly examining the bottom of the ship,
where the repairs have been pushed on very fast. The
rotten place is patched up, and made to look like new, for
Aune has been working himself all night at it. There is
some villainy at work. I believe Aune wants, out of
revenge for the use of the new machines, to send that
ship to the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Bernick:</span> This is horrible. True, Aune is an agitator
who is spreading discontent, but this is inconceivable.</p>

<p class="ij4">[<span class="smcap">Krap</span> <i>goes out, and presently</i> <span class="smcap">Lona Hessel</span> <i>enters</i>.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Bernick:</span> Well, Lona, what do you think of me now?</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Lona:</span> Just what I thought before. A lie more or
less&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Bernick:</span> I can talk to you more confidentially than
to others. I shall hide nothing from you. I had a part
in spreading that rumour about Johan and the cash-box.
But make allowance for me. Our house when I came
home from my foreign tour was threatened with ruin,
and one misfortune followed another. I was almost in
despair, and in my distraction got into that difficulty
which ended with the disappearance of Johan. Then
after you and he left various reports were spread. Some
folks declared that he had taken the money to America.
I was in such difficulty that I did not say a word to contradict
the rumours.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Lona:</span> So a lie has made you one of the pillars of
society.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Johan</span> (<i>entering</i>): I have come to tell you that I intend
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
not only to marry Dina Dorf, but to remain here and
to defy all these liars. Yesterday I promised to keep
silence, but now I need the truth. You must set me free
by telling the truth, that I may win Dina.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Bernick</span> (<i>in great agitation</i>): But just reflect on my
position. If you aim such a blow as this at me I am
ruined irretrievably. The welfare of this community is
also at stake. If my credit is not impaired, I shall soon
be a millionaire, when certain company projects mature.
Johan, go away, and I will share with you. I have
staked all I possess on schemes now about to mature, but
if my character is impaired, my utter ruin is inevitable.</p>
</div>

<blockquote>
<p class="font09 pmb1">To the surprise of Bernick, Johan announces that he will go
to America, but will shortly return for Dina, and that accordingly
he will sail next day in the <i>Indian Girl</i>, the captain having
promised to take him. He will sell his farm and be back in
two months, and then the guilty one must take the guilt on himself.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="block2a">

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Johan:</span> The wind is good, and in three weeks I shall
be across the Atlantic unless the <i>Indian Girl</i> should go to
the bottom.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Bernick</span> (<i>involuntarily starting</i>): Go to the bottom?<br />
Why should she?</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Johan:</span> Yes, indeed, why?</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Bernick</span> (<i>very softly</i>): Go to the bottom?</p>
</div>

<blockquote>
<p class="font09 pmb3">They separate, and Aune enters, and anxiously asks if Bernick
is positively determined that the American ship shall sail the
next day, on pain of his dismissal. He replies that he supposes
the repairs are properly finished, and therefore the <i>Indian Girl</i>
must sail. A merchant steps in to say that the storm-signals
have been hoisted, for a tempest is threatening. This gentleman
says to Bernick that the <i>Palm Tree</i> ought to start all the
same, for she is a splendidly-built craft, and she is only to cross
the North Sea; but as for the <i>Indian Girl</i>, such an old hulk
would be in great peril. But Bernick evades the remonstrance,
and no alteration is made in the plans of procedure. The ship
is to sail.</p>

his fellow citizens who are about to form a procession, and to

his life is at hand. But the fact that the sea is running high
outside the harbour is causing great agitation to the mind of
Bernick. Lona looks in to say that she has been saying farewell
to Johan. He has not changed his determination to sail. A
strange incident happens. Little Olaf Bernick runs away from

What have I accomplished, with all my efforts? We
who are considered the pillars of society are but its tools
after all. Since you came home from America I have
been keenly feeling all this. All this show and deception
gives me no satisfaction. But I work for my son, who
will be able to found a truer state of things and to be
happier than his father.</p>

at sea. But presently Hilmar comes to tell him that Olaf has
run away in the <i>Indian Girl</i>. He cries out that the ship must
be stopped at any cost. Krap says it is impossible. Music is
heard, for the procession is approaching. Bernick, in an agony
of soul, declares that he cannot receive anyone. The whole
street blazes with the illuminations, and on a great transparency
on the opposite house gleams the inscription, "Long live Karsten
Bernick, the Pillar of our Society!"</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bernick:</span> You will see him again, Karsten, all
right. I have got him. Do you think a mother does not
watch? I overheard a few words from our boy which
set me on my guard. I and Aune went in the sailing
boat from the yard and reached the <i>Indian Girl</i> when she
was on the point of sailing, and he was soon discovered
hiding away.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Bernick:</span> And is the ship under sail again?</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bernick:</span> No. The darkness came on more

to Bernick in the name of the committee, and expresses
the public esteem and admiration for the consul's services to
society. Bernick, to the astonishment of the audience, proceeds
to make a full confession of the duplicity and deceit of which
he has been guilty. He unreservedly places himself in the hands
of the people, who quietly disperse. Bernick at once finds that,
whatever the people may think, he has won the sympathy of all
his own circle. Lona lays her hands on his shoulder with the
words, "Brother-in-law, you have at last discovered that the
spirit of Truth and the spirit of Freedom are the real Pillars

<p><a name="Footnote_P_16" id="Footnote_P_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_P_16"><span class="label">[P]</span></a> Ben Jonson was born at Westminster in 1573. He was
brought up by his stepfather, a master bricklayer, and educated
at Westminster School, where he got his learning under Camden.
While still a youngster, he went a-fighting in the Low
Countries, returning to London about 1592. In 1598 he emerged
as a dramatic author with the play "Every Man in His Humour."
This was the first of a series of comedies, tragedies,
and masques, which rank highly. In human interest, however,
none surpassed his first success. Unlike Shakespeare, with
whom he consorted among the famous gatherings of wits at the
Mermaid Tavern, Jonson regarded himself as the exponent of
a theory of dramatic art. He was steeped in classical learning,
which he is wont to display somewhat excessively. Besides his
dramas, Jonson wrote many lyrical pieces, including some admirable
songs, and produced sundry examples of other forms
of versification. He died on August 6, 1637.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_Q_17" id="Footnote_Q_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_Q_17"><span class="label">[Q]</span></a> Juvenal was born, it is usually believed, at Aquinum, about
55 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> He lived to an advanced age, but the year of his death
is unknown. Rome he evidently knew well, and from long experience.
But there is great obscurity about his career. His
"Satires," in declamatory indignation, form a powerful contrast
to the genial mockery of Horace (p. 91): where Horace may be
said to have a Chaucerian smile for human weakness, Juvenal
displays the wrath of a Langland. Juvenal denounces abuses
at Rome in unmeasured terms. Frequently Zolaesque in his
methods of exposing vice, he contrives by his realism to produce
a loathing for the objects of his attack. Dryden rendered
into free and vigorous English several of the satires; and
Gifford wrote a complete translation, often of great merit. The
translation here has, with adaptations, been drawn from both,
and a few lines have been incorporated from Johnson, whose
two best-known poems, "London" and "The Vanity of Human
Wishes," were paraphrases from Juvenal.</p>

Near Jerusalem, once the city where God displayed His grace,
the Divine Redeemer withdrew from the multitude and sought
retirement. On the side where the sun first gilds the city with
its beams rises a mountain, whose summit He had oft honoured
with His presence when during the solitary night He spent the

the confines of heaven, and there prayed. Earth rejoiced at
the renewal of her beauty as His voice resounded and penetrated
the gates of the deep, but only He and the Eternal Father knew
the whole meaning of the divine petition. As Jesus arose from
prayer, in His face shone sublimity, love, and resignation.</p>

<p class="font09 pmb1">Now He and the Eternal Father entered on discourse mysterious
and profound, obscure even to immortals; discourse of

sunny arch, chant His praise, joining the melody of their golden
harps. During the hymn the seraph, as messenger of the Mediator,
stood on one of the suns nearest heaven. The Eternal

    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
Eternal night sank far below the heavens!<br />
Thou sawest, Eloah, how He stood on high<br />
O'er the Profound. He spake again, and, lo,<br />
A hideous mass inanimate appeared<br />
And lay before Him, seeming ruins vast<br />
Of broken suns, or of a hundred worlds<br />
To chaos crushed. He summoned then the flame,<br />
And the nocturnal blaze rushed in the fields<br />
Of everlasting death. Then misery<br />
Existed, which from the depths ascended<br />
In cries of anguish and despondency.<br />
Then was created the infernal gulf!<br />
<br />
Thus they communed. Portia no longer could<br />
The Blessed Saviour's sufferings behold,<br />
And lone ascended to the palace roof.<br />
She stood and wrung her hands, her weeping eyes<br />
To heaven uplifted, while she thus express'd<br />
The agitated feelings of her heart:<br />
"O Thou, the First of Gods, who didst create<br />
This world from night of darkness, and who gav'st<br />
A heart to man! Whatever be Thy name&mdash;<br />
God, Jupiter, Jehovah, Romulus?<br />
Or Abraham's God? Not of chosen few,<br />
Thou art the Judge and Father of us all!<br />
May I before Thee, Lord, with tears display<br />
The feelings of my heart, and rend my soul?<br />
What is the crime of this most peaceful man?<br />
Why should He thus be barbarously used<br />
And persecuted even unto death<br />
By these inhuman and relentless men?<br />
Dost Thou delight from Thine Olympus, Lord,<br />
To look on suffering virtue? Is to Thee<br />
The object sacred? To the heart of men,<br />
That is not of humanity devoid,<br />
It is most awful, wondrous, and endearing;<br />
But He who formed the stars, can He admire<br />
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
And wonder? No, far too sublime is He<br />
To admiration ever scope to give!<br />
Yet th' object must e'en to the God of Gods<br />
Be sacred, else He never could permit<br />
That thus the good and guiltless be oppress'd.<br />
My tears of pity and compassion flow,<br />
But thou discernest suffering virtue's tears<br />
That flow in secret and to Thee appeal.<br />
Great God of Gods, reward and if Thou canst,<br />
Admire the magnanimity He shows."</p>

<h3><i>V.&mdash;The Day of Oblation</i></h3>

<blockquote>
<p class="p1 font09">Eloah welcomes the returning morn with a hymn, and hails
the Day of the Atonement, precious, fair day of oblation, sent
by Love Divine.</p>

<p class="p1 font09 pmb1">The Messiah is led to Pilate, and is accused by Caiaphas and
Philo. Judas, in despair, destroys himself. Jesus is sent to
Herod, who, expecting to see a miracle, is disappointed. After
being treated with derision, Jesus is sent back to Pilate, who
seeks to save Him, but is persuaded to release Barabbas. Jesus
is scourged, arrayed in a purple robe, crowned with thorns, and
delivered to the priests, who cause Him to be led to crucifixion.
Eloah descends from the throne and proclaims that the Redeemer
is led to death, on which the angels of the earth form
a circle round Mount Calvary. Jesus is nailed to the cross.
One of the two thieves crucified with Him is converted. Uriel
places a planet before the sun to obscure the dreadful scene on
Calvary, and then conducts to earth the souls of all future generations
of mankind.</p>

<p class="font09 pmb3">The Angel of Death descends to address Jesus, Who dies.
The earth shakes, the veil of the Temple is rent, the Old Testament
saints are raised. The converted thief dies. Joseph of
Arimathea begs the body of Jesus, and he and Nicodemus wrap
it in spices and perform the interment. Mary and some devout
women meet in John's house, to which Nicodemus brings the
crown of thorns taken from the body at burial. The interment
is solemnised by choirs of risen saints and angels.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_R_18" id="Footnote_R_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_R_18"><span class="label">[R]</span></a> Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock, who was born at Quedlinburg
on July 2, 1724, and died on March 14, 1803, was one of Germany's
most famous eighteenth century poets. While studying
theology at Jena University, he conceived the idea of a great
spiritual epic, and actually planned in prose the first three cantos
of "The Messiah," which he afterwards finished at Leipzig.
These were published anonymously in the <i>Bremische Beiträge</i>
in 1748, the remaining five appearing in 1773. Although the
poem perhaps lacks in unity of conception and precision of style,
it contains many noble passages that are admitted by critics to
mark a very high order of lyrical genius. One of the chief distinctions
of Klopstock was that he was the real inaugurator of
the emancipation of the German intellect from the superficialism
of French literary ascendancy. This distinction was generously
acknowledged by Goethe, who rejoiced at Klopstock's success
in first striking the keynote of intellectual freedom in the Fatherland.
Various odes, Biblical dramas, tragedies, and hymns constitute
his other works. The "Messiah" was translated into
both English prose and verse by G. Egerstorff, his work being
published at Hamburg in 1821.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Nathan:</span> Once on a time, eastward, there dwelt a man<br />
Who prized a ring, set with a wondrous opal<br />
That made the owner loved of God and man.<br />
This ring he willed should ever more remain<br />
The heirloom of his house; and to the son<br />
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
He loved the best bequeathed it, binding him<br />
To leave it also to his best beloved,<br />
And forward so. At length the ring descended<br />
To one who had three sons he loved alike.<br />
To each in turn the doting father promisèd<br />
The ring, and on his death-bed, sorely grieving<br />
To disappoint two heirs, he had two rings<br />
Made like the first, so close that none could tell<br />
The model from the copies. These he gave<br />
To his three sons in secret, and so passed.<br />
The sequel may be guessed, the strifes, complaints&mdash;<br />
For the true ring no more could be distinguished<br />
Than now can&mdash;the true faith. Each to the judge<br />
Swore that he had the bauble from his father,<br />
And called his brother forger. Quoth the judge:<br />
"Which of you do his brothers love the best?<br />
You're silent all. You're all deceived deceivers!<br />
None of your rings is true, the true is gone.<br />
Your father sought to end its tyranny.<br />
Let each believe his own the real ring<br />
And vie with others to display its virtue.<br />
And if its power a thousand thousand years<br />
Endure in your descendants, let them then<br />

<p><a name="Footnote_S_19" id="Footnote_S_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_S_19"><span class="label">[S]</span></a> Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, one of the greatest names in German
literature, was born January 22, 1729, at Kamenz, in Saxon
Upper Lusatia, where his father was a clergyman of the
most orthodox Lutheran school. After working very hard for
five years at a school in Meissen, he proceeded to the University
of Leipzig, in 1746, with the intention of studying theology, but
he soon began to occupy himself with other matters, made the
acquaintance of actors, and acquired a great fondness for dramatic
entertainment. This sort of life, however, pained his strict
relatives, who pronounced it "sinful," and for a short time
Lessing went home. Later he proceeded to Berlin, and while
there, formed many valuable literary friendships, and established
the best literary journal of his time. "Nathan the Wise"
("Nathan der Weise") arose out of a bitter theological controversy
in which Lessing had been engaged. It was written
during the winter of 1778-79, and expresses ideas and theories
its author had already largely developed in prose. Primarily
the play is a strong plea for tolerance, the governing conception
being that noble character belongs to no particular creed, but to
all creeds, as set forth herein in the parable of the wonderful
ring. And thus it follows that there is no sufficient reason why
people holding one set of religious opinions should not tolerate
others who maintain totally different doctrines. Purely as a
drama the play may be disappointing, but regarded as a poem it
ranks with the noblest dramatic literature of the eighteenth
century. The characters abound in vitality, and some of the
passages rise to heights of great splendour. Lessing died on
February 15, 1781 (see also Vol. XX, p. 239).</p>

<span class="i0">Sat the lovers, and whispered together, beholding the moon rise</span>
<span class="i0">Over the pallid sea, and the silvery mists of the meadows.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Pleasantly rose next morn. And lo! with a summons sonorous,</span>
<span class="i0">Sounded the bell from its tower, and over the meadows a drum beat.</span>
<span class="i0">Thronged ere long was the church with men. Without, in the churchyard,</span>
<span class="i0">Waited the women. They stood by the graves, and hung on the headstones</span>
<span class="i0">Garlands of autumn leaves and evergreens fresh from the forest.</span>
<span class="i0">Then came the guards from the ships, and entered the sacred portal.</span>
<span class="i0">Straight uprose their commander, and spake from the steps of the altar.</span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"You are convened this day," he said, "by his majesty's orders.</span>
<span class="i0">Painful the task is I do, which to you I know must be grievous.</span>

<span class="i0">Namely, that all your lands, and dwellings, and cattle of all kinds,</span>
<span class="i0">Forfeited be to the crown; and that you yourselves from the province</span>
<span class="i0">Be transported to other lands. God grant you may dwell there</span>
<span class="i0">Ever as faithful subjects, a happy and peaceable people!"</span>
<span class="i0">In the midst of the tumult and angry contention that broke out,</span>
<span class="i0">Lo! the door of the chancel opened, and Father Felician</span>
<span class="i0">Entered with solemn mien, and ascended the steps of the altar.</span>
<span class="i0">Raising his hand, with a gesture he awed the throng into silence.</span>
<span class="i0">"What is this that ye do?" he said. "What madness has seized you?</span>
<span class="i0">Forty years of my life have I laboured among you and taught you,</span>
<span class="i0">Not in word alone, but in deed, to love one another!</span>
<span class="i0">Is this the fruit of my toils, of my vigils and prayers and privations?</span>
<span class="i0">Have you so soon forgotten all lessons of love and forgiveness?"</span>
<span class="i0">Few were his words of rebuke, but deep in the hearts of his people</span>
<span class="i0">Sank they, and sobs of contrition succeeded the passionate outbreak,</span>
<span class="i0">While they repeated his prayer, and said, "O Father, forgive them!"</span>

<span class="i0">Came from the neighbouring hamlets and farms the Acadian women,</span>
<span class="i0">Driving in ponderous wains their household goods to the seashore,</span>
<span class="i0">Pausing and looking back to gaze once more on their dwellings,</span>
<span class="i0">Ere they were shut from sight by the winding road and the woodland.</span>
<span class="i0">Close at their sides their children ran, and urged on the oxen,</span>
<span class="i0">While in their little hands they clasped some fragments of playthings.</span>
<span class="i0">Thus to the Gaspereau's mouth they hurried; and there on the sea-beach,</span>
<span class="i0">Piled in confusion, lay the household goods of the peasants.</span>
<span class="i0">Great disorder prevailed, and the tumult and stir of embarking</span>
<span class="i0">Busily plied the freighted boats; and in the confusion</span>
<span class="i0">Wives were torn from their husbands, and mothers, too late, saw their children</span>
<span class="i0">Left on the land, extending their arms, with wildest entreaties.</span>

<span class="i0">Columns of shining smoke uprose, and flashes of flame were</span>
<span class="i0">Thrust through their folds and withdrawn, like the quivering hands of a martyr.</span>
<span class="i0">Then as the wind seized the gleeds and the burning thatch, and, uplifting,</span>
<span class="i0">Whirled them aloft through the air, at once from a hundred housetops</span>
<span class="i0">Started the sheeted smoke with flashes of flame intermingled.</span>
<span class="i0">Overwhelmed with the sight, yet speechless, the priest and the maidens</span>
<span class="i0">Gazed on the scene of terror that reddened and widened before them;</span>
<span class="i0">And as they turned at length to speak to their silent companion,</span>

<h3><i>II.&mdash;The Quest and the Finding</i></h3>

<blockquote>
<p class="font09 pmb1">The exiles from Acadie landed some on one coast, some on
another; and the lovers were separated from one another. Evangeline
sought everywhere for Gabriel, in towns and in the country,
in churchyards and on the prairies, in the camps and battlefields
of the army, and among missions of Jesuits and Moravians.
But all in vain. She heard far and distant news of him, but
never came upon him. And so the years went by, and she grew
old in her search.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In that delightful land which is washed by the Delaware waters,</span>
<span class="i0">Guarding in sylvan shades the name of Penn, the apostle,</span>
<span class="i0">Stands on the banks of its beautiful stream the city he founded.</span>
<span class="i0">There all the air is balm, and the peach is the emblem of beauty,</span>
<span class="i0">And the streets still re-echo the names of the trees of the forest,</span>
<span class="i0">As if they fain would appease the Dryads whose haunts they molested.</span>
<span class="i0">There from the troubled sea had Evangeline landed, an exile,</span>
<span class="i0">Finding among the children of Penn a home and a country.</span>
<span class="i0">Gabriel was not forgotten. Within her heart was his image,</span>
<span class="i0">Clothed in the beauty of love and youth, as last she beheld him.</span>
<span class="i0">Over him years had no power; he was not changed, but transfigured;</span>
<span class="i0">He had become to her heart as one who is dead, and not absent.</span>
<span class="i0">Patience and abnegation of self, and devotion to others&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">This was the lesson a life of trial and sorrow had taught her.</span>
<span class="i0">Other hope had she none, nor wish in life, but to follow</span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Meekly, with reverent steps, the sacred feet of her Saviour.</span>
<span class="i0">Thus many years she lived as a Sister of Mercy; frequenting</span>
<span class="i0">Lonely and wretched roofs in the crowded lanes of the city,</span>
<span class="i0">Where disease and sorrow in garrets languished neglected.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then it came to pass that a pestilence fell on the city.</span>
<span class="i0">Wealth had no power to bribe, nor beauty to charm the oppressor;</span>
<span class="i0">But all perished alike beneath the scourge of his anger&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Only, alas! the poor, who had neither friends nor attendants,</span>
<span class="i0">Crept away to die in the almshouse, home of the homeless.</span>
<span class="i0">Thither, by night and day, came the Sister of Mercy. The dying</span>
<span class="i0">Looked up into her face, and thought, indeed, to behold there</span>
<span class="i0">Gleams of celestial light encircle her forehead with splendour,</span>
<span class="i0">Such as the artist paints o'er the brows of saints and apostles,</span>
<span class="i0">Or such as hangs by night o'er a city seen at a distance.</span>
<span class="i0">Unto their eyes it seemed the lamps of the city celestial,</span>
<span class="i0">Into whose shining gates ere long their spirits would enter.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus on a Sabbath morn, through the streets, deserted and silent,</span>
<span class="i0">Wending her quiet way, she entered the door of the almshouse.</span>
<span class="i0">Sweet on the summer air was the odour of flowers in the garden;</span>
<span class="i0">And she paused on her way to gather the fairest among them,</span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
<span class="i0">That the dying once more might rejoice in their fragrance and beauty.</span>
<span class="i0">And with light in her looks, she entered the chamber of sickness.</span>
<span class="i0">Many a languid head, upraised as Evangeline entered,</span>
<span class="i0">Turned on its pillow of pain to gaze while she passed, for her presence</span>
<span class="i0">Fell on their hearts like a ray of the sun on the walls of a prison.</span>
<span class="i0">And, as she looked around, she saw how Death, the consoler,</span>
<span class="i0">Laying his hand on many a heart, had healed it forever.</span>
<span class="i0">Suddenly, as if arrested by fear or a feeling of wonder,</span>
<span class="i0">Still she stood, with her colourless lips apart, while a shudder</span>
<span class="i0">Ran through her frame, and, forgotten, the flowerets dropped from her fingers,</span>
<span class="i0">And from her eyes and cheeks the light and bloom of the morning.</span>
<span class="i0">Then there escaped from her lips a cry of such terrible anguish</span>
<span class="i0">That the dying heard it, and started up from their pillows.</span>
<span class="i0">On the pallet before her was stretched the form of an old man.</span>
<span class="i0">Long and thin and grey were the locks that shaded his temples;</span>
<span class="i0">But, as he lay in the morning light, his face for a moment</span>
<span class="i0">Seemed to assume once more the forms of its earlier manhood.</span>
<span class="i0">Motionless, senseless, dying, he lay, and his spirit, exhausted,</span>
<span class="i0">Seemed to be sinking down through infinite depths in the darkness&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Darkness of slumber and death, forever sinking and sinking.</span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then through those realms of shade, in multiplied reverberations,</span>
<span class="i0">Heard he that cry of pain, and through the hush that succeeded</span>
<span class="i0">Whispered a gentle voice, in accents tender and saint-like,</span>
<span class="i0">"Gabriel! O my beloved!" and died away into silence.</span>
<span class="i0">Then he beheld, in a dream, once more the home of his childhood;</span>
<span class="i0">Green Acadian meadows, with sylvan rivers among them,</span>
<span class="i0">Village, and mountain, and woodlands; and walking under their shadow,</span>
<span class="i0">As in the days of her youth, Evangeline rose in his vision.</span>
<span class="i0">Tears came into his eyes; and as slowly he lifted his eyelids</span>
<span class="i0">Vanished the vision away, but Evangeline knelt by his bed-side.</span>
<span class="i0">Vainly he strove to whisper her name, for the accents unuttered,</span>
<span class="i0">Died on his lips, and their motion revealed what his tongue would have spoken.</span>
<span class="i0">Vainly he strove to rise; and Evangeline, kneeling beside him,</span>
<span class="i0">Kissed his dying lips, and laid his head on her bosom.</span>
<span class="i0">Sweet was the light of his eyes; but it suddenly sank into darkness,</span>
<span class="i0">As when a lamp is blown out by a gust of wind at a casement.</span>
<span class="i0">All was ended now&mdash;the hope, and the fear, and the sorrow,</span>
<span class="i0">All the aching of heart, the restless, unsatisfied longing,</span>
<span class="i0">All the dull, deep pain, and constant anguish of patience;</span>
<span class="i0">And, as she pressed once more the lifeless head to her bosom,</span>
<span class="i0">Meekly she bowed her own, and murmured, "Father, I thank Thee!"</span>

<p><a name="Footnote_T_20" id="Footnote_T_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_T_20"><span class="label">[T]</span></a> Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, the best-known and best-beloved
of American poets, was born at Portland, Maine, on
February 27, 1807. The son of a lawyer, he graduated at Bowdoin
College at the age of eighteen, and then entered his father's
office, not, however, with any intention of adopting the law as
a profession. Shortly afterwards, the college trustees sent him
on a European tour to qualify himself for the chair of foreign
languages, one result of which was a number of translations and
his book "Outre Mer." "Voices of the Night," his first volume
of original verse, appeared in 1839, and created a favourable impression,
which was deepened on the publication in 1841 of
Ballads, and Other Poems," containing such moving pieces
as "The Wreck of the Hesperus," "The Village Blacksmith,"
and "Excelsior." From that moment Longfellow's reputation
as poet was established&mdash;he became a singer whose charm and
simplicity not only appealed to his own countrymen, but to English-speaking
people the world over. In 1847 he produced what
many regard as the greatest of his works, namely, "Evangeline,
a Tale of Acadie." The story is founded on the compulsory
expatriation by the British of the people of Acadia (Nova
Scotia), in 1713, on the charge of having assisted the French
(from whom they were descended) at a siege of the war then
in progress. The poem is told with infinite pathos and rare
narrative power. Longfellow died on March 24, 1882.</p>

<h3><i>I.&mdash;Of Hiawatha and His Battle with Mudjekeewis</i></h3>

<blockquote>
<p class="font09 pmb1">Hiawatha was sent by Gitche Manito, the Master of Life, as
a prophet to guide and to teach the tribes of men, and to toil
and suffer with them. If they listened to his counsels they would
multiply and prosper, but if they paid no heed they would fade
away and perish. His father was Mudjekeewis, the West Wind;
his mother was Wenonah, the first-born daughter of Nokomis,
who was the daughter of the Moon. Wenonah died in her
anguish deserted by the West Wind, and Hiawatha was brought
up and taught by the old Nokomis. He soon learned the language
of every bird and every beast; and Iagoo, the great
boaster and story-teller, made him a bow with which he shot
the red deer. When he grew into manhood he put many questions
concerning his mother to the old Nokomis, and having
learned her story, resolved, despite all warnings, to take vengeance
on Mudjekeewis.</p>

<h3><i>II.&mdash;Of Hiawatha's Friends and of His Fight with
Pearl-Feather</i></h3>

<blockquote>
<p class="font09 pmb1">The first exertion which Hiawatha made for the profit of his
people was to fast for seven days in order to procure for them
the blessing of Mondamin, the friend of man. At sunset of the
fourth, fifth, and sixth days Hiawatha wrestled with the youth
Mondamin, and on the evening of the seventh day Mondamin,
having fallen lifeless in the combat, was stripped of his green
and yellow garments and laid in the earth. From his grave
shot up the maize in all its beauty, the new gift of the Great
Spirit; and for a time Hiawatha rested from his labours, taking
counsel for furthering the prosperity of his people with his two
good friends&mdash;Chibiabos, the great singer and musician; and
Kwasind, the very strong man. But he was not long inactive.
He built the first birch canoe, and, with the help of Kwasind,
cleared the river of its sunken logs and sand-bars; and when
he and his canoe were swallowed by the monstrous sturgeon
Mishe-Nahma, he killed it by smiting fiercely on its heart. Not
long afterwards his grandmother, Nokomis, incited him to kill
the great Pearl-Feather, Megissogwon, the magician who had
slain her father. Pearl-Feather was the sender of white fog, of
pestilential vapours, of fever and of poisonous exhalations, and,
although he was guarded by the Kenabeek, the great fiery surpents,
Hiawatha sailed readily in his birch canoe to encounter
him.</p>

<span class="i4">Soon he reached the fiery serpents,</span>
<span class="i2">The Kenabeek, the great serpents,</span>
<span class="i2">Lying huge upon the water,</span>
<span class="i2">Sparkling, rippling in the water,</span>
<span class="i2">Lying coiled across the passage,</span>
<span class="i2">With their blazing crests uplifted,</span>
<span class="i2">Breathing fiery fogs and vapours,</span>
<span class="i2">So that none could pass beyond them.</span>
<span class="i2">Then he raised his bow of ash-tree,</span>
<span class="i2">Seized his arrows, jasper-headed,</span>
<span class="i2">Shot them fast among the serpents;</span>
<span class="i2">Every twanging of the bow-string</span>
<span class="i2">Was a war-cry and a death-cry,</span>
<span class="i2">Every whizzing of an arrow</span>
<span class="i2">Was a death-song of Kenabeek.</span>
  <span class="i4">Then he took the oil of Nahma,</span>

  <span class="i4">Straightway from the shining wigwam</span>

<span class="i2">Dark and terrible in aspect,</span>
<span class="i2">Clad from head to foot in wampum,</span>

<span class="i2">Till at sunset, Hiawatha,</span>
<span class="i2">Leaning on his bow of ash-tree,</span>
<span class="i2">Wounded, weary, and desponding,</span>
<span class="i2">With his mighty war-club broken,</span>
<span class="i2">With his mittens torn and tattered,</span>
<span class="i2">And three useless arrows only,</span>
<span class="i2">Paused to rest beneath a pine-tree.</span>
  <span class="i4">Suddenly, from the boughs above him</span>
<span class="i2">Sang the Mama, the woodpecker:</span>
<span class="i2">"Aim your arrow, Hiawatha,</span>
<span class="i2">At the head of Megissogwon,</span>

  <span class="i4">Winged with feathers, tipped with jasper,</span>
<span class="i2">Swift flew Hiawatha's arrow,</span>
<span class="i2">Just as Megissogwon, stooping</span>
<span class="i2">Raised a heavy stone to throw it.</span>
<span class="i2">Full upon the crown it struck him,</span>
<span class="i2">And he reeled and staggered forward.</span>
<span class="i2">Swifter flew the second arrow,</span>
<span class="i2">Wounding sorer than the other;</span>
<span class="i2">And the knees of Megissogwon</span>
<span class="i2">Bent and trembled like the rushes.</span>

<h3><i>III.&mdash;Hiawatha's Life with His People and His
Departing Westward</i></h3>

<blockquote>
<p class="font09 pmb1">When Hiawatha was returning from his battle with Mudjekeewis
he had stopped at the wigwam of the ancient Arrow-maker
to purchase heads of arrows, and there and then he had
noticed the beauty of the Arrow-maker's daughter, Minnehaha,
Laughing Water. Her he now took to wife, and celebrated his
nuptials by a wedding-feast at which Chibiabos sang, and the
handsome mischief-maker, Pau-Puk-Keewis, danced. Minnehaha
proved another blessing to the people. In the darkness of
the night, covered by her long hair only, she walked all round
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
the fields of maize, making them fruitful, and drawing a magic
circle round them which neither blight nor mildew, neither worm
nor insect, could invade. About this same time, too, to prevent the
memory of men and things fading, Hiawatha invented picture-writing,
and taught it to his people. But soon misfortunes came
upon him. The evil spirits, the Manitos of mischief, broke the ice
beneath his friend Chibiabos, and drowned him; Pau-Puk-Keewis
put insult upon him, and had to be hunted down; and the
envious Little People, the mischievous Puk-Wudjies, conspired
against Kwasind, and murdered him. After this ghosts paid a
visit to Hiawatha's wigwam, and famine came upon the land.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_U_21" id="Footnote_U_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_U_21"><span class="label">[U]</span></a> In 1854 Longfellow resigned his professorship at Harvard.
"Evangeline" had been followed by "Kavanagh," a novel of
no particular merit, a cluster of minor poems, and in 1851 by
the "Golden Legend," a singularly beautiful lyric drama, based
on Hartmann van Aue's story "Der arme Heinrichs." Leaving
the dim twilight of mediæval Germany, the poet brought his
imagination to bear upon the Red Indian and his store of
legend. The result was the "Song of Hiawatha," in 1855. Both
in subject and in metre the poem is a conscious imitation of
the Finnish "Kalevala." It was immensely popular on its
appearance, Emerson declaring it "sweet and wholesome as
maize." If the poem lacks veracity as an account of savage life,
it nevertheless overflows with the beauty of the author's own
nature, and is typical of those elements in his poetry which
have endeared his name to the English-speaking world. With
the exception of "Evangeline," it is the most popular of Longfellow's
works.</p>

<p class="font09">The profoundest speculations on the nature of things are not
impious. Let not the reader feel that in such an inquiry he is
on guilty ground. It is, rather, true that religion has caused
foul crimes. An instance is the agonising sacrifice of sweet
Iphigenia, slain at the altar to appease divine wrath.</p>

<p class="font09 pmb3">"Religion could such wickedness suggest." Tales of eternal
punishment frighten only those ignorant of the real nature of

<h3><i>II.&mdash;First Principles and a Theory of the Universe</i></h3>

<div class="block2a">
<blockquote>
<p class="font09 pmb1">Of these the first is that nothing is made of nothing; the
second, that nothing is reduced to nothing. This indestructibility
of matter may be illustrated by the joyous and constantly
renewed growth that is in nature. There are two fundamental
postulates required to explain nature&mdash;atoms and void. These
constitute the universe. There is no <i>tertium quid</i>. All other
things are but properties and accidents of these two. Atoms
are solid, "without void"; they are indestructible, "eternal";
they are indivisible. To appreciate the physical theory of Epicurus,
it is necessary to note the erroneous speculations of other
Greek thinkers, whether, like Heraclitus, they deduced all things
from one such fundamental element as fire, or whether they
postulated four elements. From a criticism of the theories of
Empedocles and Anaxagoras, the poet, return to the main subject.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="p2 font09 pmb1">Greater or less solidity depends on the resilience of atoms.
Their ceaseless motion is illustrated by the turmoil of motes
in a stream of sunlight let into a dark room. As to their
velocity, it greatly exceeds that of the sun's rays. This welter
of atoms is the product of chance; the very blemishes of the
world forbid one to regard it as divine. But the atoms do not
rain through space in rigidly parallel lines. A minute swerve
in their motion is essential to account for clashings and production;
and in the ethical sphere it is this swerve which saves the
mind from "Necessity" and makes free will possible. Though
the universe appears to be at rest, this is a fallacy of the senses,
due to the fact that the motions of "first bodies" are not cognisable
by our eyes; indeed, a similar phenomenon is the apparent
vanishing of motion due to distance; for a white spot
on a far-off hill may really be a frolicsome lamb.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="p2 font09 pmb1">The shapes of atoms vary; and so differences of species, and
differences within the same species, arise. This variety in shape
accounts, too, for the varying action and effects of atoms. Atoms
in hard bodies, for example, are mainly hooked; but in liquids
mainly smooth. In each thing, however, there are several kinds,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
which furnish that particular thing with a variety of properties.
Furthermore, atoms are colourless, for in themselves they are
invisible; they never come into the light, whereas colour needs
light&mdash;witness the changing hues of the down on a pigeon's
neck, or of a peacock's tail. Atoms are themselves without
senses, though they produce things possessed of senses. To
grasp the origin of species and development of animate nature,
one must realise the momentous importance of the arrangement
and interconnection of atoms. Wood and other rotting bodies
will bring forth worms, because material particles undergo, under
altered conditions, fresh permutations and combinations.
One may ask, what of man? He can laugh and weep, he can
discuss the composition of all things, and even inquire into the
nature of those very atoms! It is true that he springs from
them. Yet a man may laugh without being made of laughing
atoms, and a man may reason without being made of reasonable
atoms!</p>

<h3><i>III.&mdash;Of Mind and Soul and Death</i></h3>

<p class="font09 pmb1">Mind and soul are portions of the body. While mind is the
ruling element, they are both of the nature of the body&mdash;only
they are composed of exceedingly minute and subtle atoms capable
of marvellous speed. Therefore, when death deprives the
body of mind, it does not make the body appreciably
lighter.</p>

<p class="p2 font09 pmb1">Mind and soul consist of spirit, air, heat, and an elusive fourth
constituent, the nimblest and subtlest of essences, the very "soul
of the soul." It follows that mind and soul are mortal. Among
many proofs may be adduced their close interconnection with
the body, as seen in cases of drunkenness and epilepsy; their
curability by medicine; their inability to recall a state prior to
their incarnation; their liability to be influenced by heredity
like corporeal seeds. Besides, why should an immortal soul
need to quit the body at death? Decay surely could not hurt
immortality! Then, again, imagine souls contending for homes
in a body about to be born! Consequently, the soul being
mortal, death has no sting.</p>

learned from the lightning-flash and from conflagrations due to
spontaneous combustion or chance friction. In time this opened
out the possibility of many arts, such as metal-working; for
forest fires caused streams of silver, gold, copper, or lead to run
into hollows, and early man observed that when cooled, the
glittering lumps retained the mould of the cavities. Nature
also was the model for sowing and grafting. Those who excelled
in mental endowment invented new modes of life. Towns
and strongholds were founded as places of defence; and possessions
were secured by personal beauty, strength, or cleverness.
But the access of riches often ousted the claims of both
beauty and strength.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_V_22" id="Footnote_V_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_V_22"><span class="label">[V]</span></a> To the Roman poet Titus Corus Lucretius (99-55 B.C.) belongs
the distinction of having made Epicureanism epic. Possessed
by a desire to free his fellow men from the trammels of
superstition and the dread of death, he composed his poem,
"On the Nature of Things." His reasonings were based on the
atomic theory, which the Greek Epicurus had taken as the
physical side of his system. In natural law Lucretius found
the true antidote to superstition, and from a materialistic hypothesis
of atoms and void he deduced everything. Against the
futilities of myth-religion he protested with the fervour of an
evangelist. On the ethical side, he accepted from Epicurus the
conception that the ideal lies in pleasure&mdash;not wild, sensual
pleasure, but that calm of mind which comes from temperate
and refined enjoyment, subdual of extravagant passion, and
avoidance of political entanglements. It is appropriate that the
life of this apostle of scientific quietism should be involved in
obscurity. The story of his insanity, so beautifully treated by
Tennyson, may or may not be true. It is hardly credible that
a work so closely reasoned was, as a whole, composed in lucid
intervals between fits of madness; but, on the other hand, there
are signs of flagging in the later portions, and the work comes
to a sudden conclusion. The translations are specially made by
Prof. J. Wight Duff, and include a few extracts from his "Literary
History of Rome."</p>

<h3><i>I.&mdash;Carthon</i></h3>

<p>A tale of the times of old&mdash;the deeds of days of other
years.</p>

<p>Who comes from the land of strangers, with his thousands
around him? The sunbeam pours its bright
stream before him; his hair meets the wind of his hills.
His face is settled from war. He is calm as the evening
beam that looks, from the cloud of the west, on Cona's
silent vale. Who is it but Fingal, the king of mighty
deeds! The feast is spread around; the night passed
away in joy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell," said the mighty Fingal to Clessammor, "the
tale of thy youthful days. Let us hear the sorrow of
thy youth, and the darkness of thy days."</p>

<p>"It was in the days of peace," replied the great Clessammor.
"I came in my bounding ship to Balclutha's
walls of towers. Three days I remained in Reuthamir's
halls, and saw his daughter&mdash;that beam of light. Her
eyes were like the stars of night. My love for Moina
was great; my heart poured forth in joy.</p>

<p>"The son of a stranger came&mdash;a chief who loved the
white-bosomed Moina. The strength of his pride arose.
We fought; he fell beneath my sword. The banks of
Clutha heard his fall, a thousand spears glittered around.
I fought; the strangers prevailed. I plunged into the
stream of Clutha. My white sails rose over the waves,
and I bounded on the dark-blue sea. Moina came to
the shore, her loose hair flew on the wind, and I heard
her mournful, distant cries. Often did I turn my ship,
but the winds of the east prevailed. Nor Clutha ever
since have I seen, nor Moina of the dark-brown hair.
She fell in Balclutha, for I have seen her ghost. I knew
her as she came through the dusky night, along the
murmur of Lora. She was like the new moon seen
through the gathered mist, when the sky pours down its
flaky snow and the world is silent and dark."</p>

<p>"Raise, ye bards," said the mighty Fingal, "the
praise of unhappy Moina."</p>

<p>The night passed away in song; morning returned in
joy. The mountains showed their grey heads; the blue
face of ocean smiled. But as the sun rose on the sea
Fingal and his heroes beheld a distant fleet. Like a
mist on the ocean came the strange ships, and discharged
their youth upon the coast. Carthon, their
chief, was among them, like the stag in the midst of the
herd. He was a king of spears, and as he moved towards
Selma his thousands moved behind him.</p>

<p>"Go, with a song of peace," said Fingal. "Go, Ullin,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
to the king of spears. Tell him that the ghosts of our
foes are many; but renowned are they who have feasted
in my halls!"</p>

<p>When Ullin came to the mighty Carthon, he raised
the song of peace.</p>

<p>"Come to the feast of Fingal, Carthon, from the rolling
sea! Partake of the feast of the king, or lift the
spear of war. Behold that field, O Carthon. Many a
green hill rises there, with mossy stones and rustling
grass. These are the tombs of Fingal's foes, the sons
of the rolling sea!"</p>

<p>"Dost thou speak to the weak in arms," said Carthon,
"bard of the woody Morven? Have not I seen
the fallen Balclutha? And shall I feast with Fingal, the
son of Comhal, who threw his fire in the midst of my
father's hall? I was young, and knew not the cause
why the virgins wept. But when the years of my youth
came on, I beheld the moss of my fallen walls; my sigh
arose with the morning, and my tears descended with
night. Shall I not fight, I said to my soul, against the
children of my foes? And I will fight, O bard! I feel
the strength of my soul."</p>

<p>His people gathered round the hero, and drew their
shining swords. The spear trembled in his hand.
Bending forward, he seemed to threaten the king.</p>

<p>"Who of my chiefs," said Fingal, "will meet the son
of the rolling sea? Many are his warriors on the
coast, and strong is his ashen spear."</p>

<p>Cathul rose, in his strength, the son of the mighty
Lormar. Three hundred youths attend the chief, the
race of his native streams. Feeble was his arm against
Carthon; he fell, and his heroes fled. Connal resumed
the battle, but he broke his heavy spear; he lay bound
on the field; Carthon pursued his people.</p>

<p>"Clessammor," said the king of Morven, "where is
the spear of my strength? Wilt thou behold Connal
bound?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>Clessammor rose in the strength of his steel, shaking
his grizzly locks. He fitted the shield to his side; he
rushed, in the pride of valour.</p>

<p>Carthon saw the hero rushing on, and loved the
dreadful joy of his face; his strength, in the locks of age!</p>

<p>"Stately are his steps of age," he said. "Lovely the
remnant of his years! Perhaps it is the husband of
Moina, the father of car-borne Carthon. Often have I
heard that he dwelt at the echoing stream of Lora."</p>

<p>Such were his words, when Clessammor came, and
lifted high his spear. The youth received it on his
shield, and spoke the words of peace.</p>

<p>"Warrior of the aged locks! Hast thou no son to
raise the shield before his father to meet the arm of
youth? What will be the fame of my sword shouldst
thou fall?"</p>

<p>"It will be great, thou son of pride!" began the tall
Clessammor. "I have been renowned in battle, but I
never told my name to a foe. Yield to me, son of the
wave; then shalt thou know that the mark of my sword
is in many a field."</p>

<p>"I never yield, king of spears!" replied the noble
pride of Carthon. "Retire among thy friends! Let
younger heroes fight."</p>

<p>"Why dost thou wound my soul?" replied Clessammor,
with a tear. "Age does not tremble on my hand;
I still can lift the sword. Shall I fly in Fingal's sight,
in the sight of him I love? Son of the sea, I never fled!
Exalt thy pointed spear!"</p>

<p>They fought, like two contending winds that strive
to roll the wave. Carthon bade his spear to err; he
still thought that the foe was the spouse of Moina. He
broke Clessammor's beamy spear in twain; he seized
his shining sword. But as Carthon was binding the
chief, the chief drew the dagger of his fathers. He saw
the foe's uncovered side, and opened there a wound.</p>

<p>Fingal saw Clessammor low; he moved in the sound of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
his steel. The host stood silent in his presence; they
turned their eyes to the king. He came, like the sullen
noise of a storm before the winds arise. Carthon stood
in his place; the blood is rushing down his side; he saw
the coming down of the king. Pale was his cheek; his
hair flew loose, his helmet shook on high. The force of
Carthon failed, but his soul was strong.</p>

<p>"King of Morven," Carthon said, "I fall in the midst
of my course. But raise my remembrance on the banks
of Lora, where my father dwelt. Perhaps the husband
of Moina will mourn over his fallen Carthon."</p>

<p>His words reached Clessammor. He fell, in silence,
on his son. The host stood darkened around; no voice
is on the plain. Night came; the moon from the east
looked on the mournful field; but still they stood, like
a silent grove that lifts its head on Gormal, when the
loud winds are laid, and dark autumn is on the plain;
and then they died.</p>

<p>Fingal was sad for Carthon; he commanded his bards
to sing the hero's praise. Ossian joined them, and this
was his song: "My soul has been mournful for Carthon;
he fell in the days of his youth. And thou, O
Clessammor, where is thy dwelling in the wind? Has
the youth forgot his wound? Flies he, on clouds, with
thee? Perhaps they may come to my dreams. I think I
hear a feeble voice! The beam of heaven delights to
shine on the grave of Carthon. I feel it warm around.</p>

<p>"O thou that rollest above, round as the shield of my
fathers! Whence are thy beams, O sun, thy everlasting
light? Thou comest forth in thy awful beauty; the stars
hide themselves in the sky; the moon, cold and pale,
sinks in the western wave. But thou thyself movest
alone. Who can be a companion of thy course? The
oaks of the mountains fall; the mountains themselves
decay with years; the ocean shrinks and grows again;
the moon herself is lost in heaven; but thou art for ever
the same, rejoicing in the brightness of thy course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p class="pmb3">"When the world is dark with tempests; when thunder
rolls, and lightning flies, thou lookest in thy beauty from
the clouds, and laughest at the storm. But to Ossian
thou lookest in vain, for he beholds thy beams no
more; whether thy yellow hair flows on the eastern
clouds, or thou tremblest at the gates of the west. But
thou art perhaps, like me, for a season; thy years will
have an end. Thou shalt sleep in thy clouds; careless
of the voice of the morning. Exult thee, O sun, in the
strength of thy youth! Age is dark and unlovely. It
is like the glimmering light of the moon when it shines
through broken clouds and the mist is on the hills; the
blast of north is on the plain; the traveller shrinks in the
midst of his journey."</p>


<h3><i>II.&mdash;Darthula</i></h3>

<p>Daughter of heaven, fair art thou! The silence of thy
face is pleasant! Thou comest forth in loveliness. The
stars attend thy blue course in the east. The clouds
rejoice in thy presence, O moon! Look from thy gates
in the sky. Burst the cloud, O wind, that the daughter
of night may look forth, that the shaggy mountains
may brighten, and the ocean roll its white waves in
light!</p>

<p>Nathos is on the deep, and Althos, that beam of
youth. Ardan is near his brothers. They move in the
gloom of their course. The sons of Usnoth move in
darkness, from the wrath of Cairbar of Erin. Who is
that, dim, by their side? The night has covered her
beauty! Who is it but Darthula, the first of Erin's
maids? She has fled from the love of Caribar, with
blue-shielded Nathos. But the winds deceive thee, O
Darthula! They deny the woody Etha to thy sails.
These are not the mountains of Nathos; nor is that the
roar of his climbing waves. The halls of Cairbar are
near; the towers of the foe lift their heads! Erin
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
stretches its green head into the sea. Tura's bay receives
the ship. Where have ye been, ye southern winds,
when the sons of my love were deceived? But ye have
been sporting on plains, pursuing the thistle's beard.
Oh that ye had been rustling in the sails of Nathos till
the hills of Etha arose; till they arose in their clouds,
and saw their returning chief!</p>

<p>Long hast thou been absent, Nathos&mdash;the day of thy
return is past! Lovely thou wast in the eyes of Darthula.
Thy soul was generous and mild, like the hour
of the setting sun. But when the rage of battle rose,
thou wast a sea in a storm. The clang of thy arms was
terrible; the host vanished at the sound of thy coarse.
It was then Darthula beheld thee from the top of her
mossy tower; from the tower of Selama, where her
fathers dwelt.</p>

<p>"Lovely art thou, O stranger!" she said, for her
trembling soul arose. "Fair art thou in thy battles,
friend of the fallen Cormac! Why dost thou rush on in
thy valour, youth of the ruddy look? Few are thy
hands in fight against the dark-browed Cairbar! Oh that
I might be freed from his love&mdash;that I might rejoice in
the presence of Nathos!"</p>

<p>Such were thy words, Darthula, in Selama's mossy
towers. But now the night is around thee. The winds
have deceived thy sails, Darthula! Cease a little while,
O north wind! Let me hear the voice of the lovely.
Thy voice is lovely, Darthula, between the rustling
blasts!</p>

<p>"Are these the rocks of Nathos?" she said. "This
the roar of his mountain streams? Comes that beam of
light from Usnoth's mighty hall? The mist spreads
around; the beam is feeble and distant far. But the
light of Darthula's soul dwells in the chief of Etha!
Son of the generous Usnoth, why that broken sigh?
Are we in the land of strangers, chief of echoing
Etha?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p>"These are not the rocks of Nathos," he replied,
"nor this the roar of his streams. We are in the land
of strangers, in the land of cruel Cairbar. The winds
have deceived us, Darthula. Erin lifts here her hills.
Go towards the north, Althos; be thy steps, Ardan,
along the coast; that the foe may not come in darkness,
and our hopes of Etha fail. I will go towards that
mossy tower to see who dwells about the beam."</p>

<p>He went. She sat alone; she heard the rolling of the
wave. The big tear is in her eye. She looks for returning
Nathos.</p>

<p>He returned, but his face was dark.</p>

<p>"Why art thou sad, O Nathos?" said the lovely
daughter of Colla.</p>

<p>"We are in the land of foes," replied the hero.
"The winds have deceived us, Darthula. The strength
of our friends is not near, nor the mountains of Etha.
Where shall I find thy peace, daughter of mighty Colla?
The brothers of Nathos are brave, and his own sword
has shone in fight! But what are the sons of Usnoth
to the host of dark-browed Cairbar? Oh that the winds
had brought thy sails, Oscar, king of men! Thou didst
promise to come to the battles of fallen Cormac! Cairbar
would tremble in his halls, and peace dwell round
the lovely Darthula. But why dost thou fall, my soul?
The sons of Usnoth may prevail!"</p>

<p>"And they will prevail, O Nathos!" said the rising
soul of the maid. "Never shall Darthula behold the
halls of gloomy Cairbar. Give me those arms of brass,
that glitter to the passing meteor. I see them dimly in
the dark-bosomed ship. Darthula will enter the battle
of steel."</p>

<p>Joy rose in the face of Nathos when he heard the
white-bosomed maid. He looks towards the coming of
Cairbar. The wind is rustling in his hair. Darthula is
silent at his side. Her look is fixed on the chief. She
strives to hide the rising sigh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>Morning rose with its beams. The sons of Erin appear,
like grey rocks, with all their trees; they spread
along the coast. Cairbar stood in the midst. He
grimly smiled when he saw the foe. Nathos rushed
forward, in his strength; nor could Darthula stay behind.
She came with the hero, lifting her shining spear.</p>

<p>"Come," said Nathos to Cairbar&mdash;"come, chief of
high Temora! Let our battle be on the coast, for the
white-bosomed maid. His people are not with Nathos;
they are behind these rolling seas. Why dost thou
bring thy thousands against the chief of Etha?"</p>

<p>"Youth of the heart of pride," replied Cairbar, "shall
Erin's king fight with thee? Thy fathers were not
among the renowned, and Cairbar does not fight with
feeble men!"</p>

<p>The tear started from car-borne Nathos. He turned
his eyes to his brothers. Their spears flew at once.
Three heroes lay on earth. Then the light of their
swords gleamed on high. The ranks of Erin yield, as
a ridge of dark clouds before a blast of wind! Then
Cairbar ordered his people, and they drew a thousand
bows. A thousand arrows flew. The sons of Usnoth
fell in blood. They fell like three young oaks, which
stood alone on the hill. The traveller saw the lovely
trees, and wondered how they grew so lonely; the blast
of the desert came by night, and laid their green heads
low; next day he returned, but they were withered, and
the heath was bare!</p>

<p>Darthula stood in silent grief, and beheld their fall!
Pale was her cheek. Her trembling lips broke short a
half-formed word. Her breast of snow appeared. It
appeared; but it was stained with blood. An arrow was
fixed in her side. She fell on the fallen Nathos, like a
wreath of snow! Her hair spreads wide on his face.
Their blood is mixing round!</p>

<p>"Daughter of Colla&mdash;thou art low!" said Cairbar's
hundred bards. "When wilt thou rise in thy beauty,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
first of Erin's maids? Thy sleep is long in the tomb.
The sun shall not come to thy bed and say, 'Awake,
Darthula! Awake thou first of women! The wind of
spring is abroad. The flowers shake their heads on the
green hills. The winds wave their growing leaves.' Retire,
O sun, the daughter of Colla is asleep! She will not
come forth in her beauty. She will not move in the steps
of her loveliness!"</p>

<p class="pmb3">Such was the song of the bards when they raised the
tomb. I, too, sang over the grave when the king of
Morven came to green Erin to fight with the car-borne
Cairbar!</p>


<div class="footnotes"><span class="font11"><b>FOOTNOTES:</b></span>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_W_23" id="Footnote_W_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_W_23"><span class="label">[W]</span></a> No ancient or modern work in the history of literature has
excited such wild admiration and such profound contempt as
the "Ossian" of James Macpherson. It was Napoleon's favourite
work; he carried it with him to Egypt and took it to St.
Helena. Byron and Goethe and Chateaubriand were also
touched to enthusiasm by it. Its author&mdash;or, as some still think,
its editor&mdash;was a Scottish schoolmaster, James Macpherson,
born at Ruthven, in Inverness-shire on October 27, 1736. The
first part of the work, entitled "Fragments of Ancient Poetry,
Collected in the Highlands of Scotland, and Translated from
the Gaelic, or Erse, Language," was published in 1760; "Fingal"
appeared in 1762, and "Temora" in the following year.
Doctor Johnson said of Macpherson: "He has found names,
and stories, and phrases, nay, passages in old songs, and with
them has blended his own compositions, and so made what he
gives to the world as the translation of an ancient poem"; and
this verdict is now confirmed by the best authorities. Nevertheless,
"Ossian" is a work of considerable merit and great
historic interest. It contains some fine passages of real poetry,
such as the invocation to the sun with which "Carthon" concludes,
and it has served to attract universal attention to the
magnificent Celtic traditions of Scotland and Ireland. Macpherson
died in Inverness-shire on February 17, 1796.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_X_24" id="Footnote_X_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_X_24"><span class="label">[X]</span></a> Christopher Marlowe was born at Canterbury in February,
1564, the year of Shakespeare's birth. From the King's School
he went to Cambridge, at Corpus, and took his degree in 1583.
For the next ten years, he lived in London; a tavern brawl ended
his career on June 1, 1593. During those ten years, when Greene
and Nashe and Peele were beginning to shape the nascent drama,
and Shakespeare was serving his apprenticeship, most of the
young authors were living wild enough lives, and none, according
to tradition, wilder than Kit Marlowe; who, nevertheless, was
doing mightier work, work more pregnant with promise than any
of them, and infinitely greater in achievement; for Shakespeare's
tragedies were still to come. That "Tamburlaine the Great," the
first play of a lad of twenty-three, should have been crude and
bombastic is not surprising; that "The Tragical History of Dr.
Faustus" should have been produced by an author aged probably
less than twenty-five is amazing. The story is traditional;
two hundred years after Marlowe, Goethe gave it its most
familiar setting (see Vol. XVI, p. 362). But although some part
of Marlowe's play is grotesque, there is no epithet which can
fitly characterise its greatest scenes except "tremendous." What
may not that tavern brawl have cost the world!</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_Y_25" id="Footnote_Y_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_Y_25"><span class="label">[Y]</span></a> Martial (Marcus Valerius Martialis) was born at Bilbilis, in
Spain, about 40 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> He went to Rome when twenty-four, and
by attaching himself to the influential family of his fellow
Spaniards, Seneca and Lucan, won his first introduction to
Roman society. The earliest of his books which we possess
celebrates the games associated with the dedication of the
Flavian amphitheatre, the Colosseum, by Titus, in 80 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> Most
of his other books belong to the reign of Domitian, to whom
he cringed with fulsome adulation. After a residence in Rome
during thirty-four years, he returned to Spain. He died probably
soon after 102 <span class="smcap">a.d</span>. Martial's importance to literature rests
chiefly on two facts. He made a permanent impress upon the
epigram by his gift of concise and vigorous utterance, culminating
in a characteristically sharp sting; and he left in his
verses, even where they are coarsest, an extraordinarily graphic
index to the pleasure-loving and often corrupt society of his
day. Martial had no deep seriousness of outlook upon life; yet
he had better things in him than flippancy. He wearied of his
long career of attendance upon patrons who requited him but
shabbily; and with considerable taste for rural scenery, he
longed for a more open-air existence than was attainable in
Rome. Where he best exhibited genuine feeling was in his
laments for the dead and his affection for friends. With the
exception of the introductory piece from Byron, the verse translations
here are by Professor Wight Duff.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_Z_26" id="Footnote_Z_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_Z_26"><span class="label">[Z]</span></a> Of all Shakespeare's immediate successors one of the most
powerful, as well as the most prolific, was Philip Massinger. The
son of a retainer in the household of the Earl of Pembroke, he
was born during the second half of 1583, and entered St. Alban's
Hall, Oxford, in 1602, but left without a degree four years later.
Coming to London, he appears to have mixed freely with writers
for the stage, and soon made a reputation as playwright. The
full extent of his literary activities is not known, inasmuch as
a great deal of his work has been lost. He also collaborated
with other authors, particularly with Fletcher (see Vol. XVI, p.
133) in whose grave he was buried on March 18, 1639. It is certain,
however, that he wrote single-handed fifteen plays, of which
the best known is the masterly and satirical comedy, "A New
Way to Pay Old Debts." Printed in 1633, but probably written
between 1625 and 1626, the piece retained its popularity longer
than any other of Massinger's plays. The construction is ingenious,
the dialogue witty, but the <i>dramatis personæ</i>, with the exception
of Sir Giles Overreach, are feeble and without vitality.</p>

heavenly fragrance around; then moving through the
forest is seen by Adam, who, with Eve, entertains him, and
seizes the occasion to ask him of "their Being Who dwell in
Heaven," and further, what is meant by the angelic caution&mdash;"If
ye be found obedient." Raphael thereupon tells of the disobedience,
in Heaven, of Satan, and his fall, "from that high
state of bliss into what woe." He tells how the Divine decree
of obedience to the Only Son was received by Satan with envy,
because he felt "himself impaired"; and how, consulting with
Beelzebub, he drew away all the Spirits under their command
to the "spacious North," and, taunting them with being eclipsed,
proposed that they should rebel. Only Abdiel remained faithful,

powers of Satan are hastening on to set the Proud Aspirer on
the very Mount of God. "Long time in even scale the battle

the Messiah to ascend his chariot, and end the strife. "Far

pleasant labours, Eve suggested that they should work apart,

to Heaven to report their failure, but are reminded by God that
it was ordained; and the Son is sent down to judge the guilty
pair, after hearing their excuses, and to punish them with the
curses of toil and death. Meantime Sin and Death "snuff the
smell of mortal change" on Earth, and leaving Hell-gate "belching
outrageous flame," erect a broad road from Hell to Earth
through Chaos, and as they come in sight of the World meet
Satan steering his way back as an angel, "between the Centaur
and the Scorpion." He makes Sin and Death his plenipotentiaries
on Earth, adjuring them first to make man their thrall, and
lastly kill; and as they pass to the evil work "the blasted stars
look wan." The return to Hell is received with loud acclaim,
which comes in the form of a hiss, and Satan and all his hosts
are turned into grovelling snakes. Adam, now in his repentance,
is sternly resentful against Eve, who becomes submissive, and
both pass from remorse to "sorrow unfeigned and humiliation
meek.'</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_AA_27" id="Footnote_AA_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AA_27"><span class="label">[AA]</span></a> John Milton, the peer of Dante as one of the world's master-poets,
was born in Bread Street, London, on December 9,
1608, the son of a well-to-do scrivener. Educated at St. Paul's
School and at Cambridge, he devoted himself from the first to
poetry. The "Ode on the Nativity" was written when the poet
was twenty-one. His productions till his thirtieth year were
nearly all of a classical caste&mdash;"L'Allegro," "Il Penseroso,"
"Comus," "Lycidas." Returning from Continental travels in
1639, Milton became enmeshed in politics, and so continued for
twenty years, during which time he wrote much polemical prose,
including his "Areopagitica" (see Vol. XX, p. 257) and his
"Tractate on Education." After a spell of teaching and pamphleteering,
he served as Latin secretary to Oliver Cromwell, and
was stricken with blindness at the age of forty-four. Though
poor by loss of office after the Restoration, he was never in
poverty. He died on November 8, 1674. "Paradise Lost,"
planned in his youth, was actually begun in 1658, finished in
1665, and published in 1667. The price arranged was £5 down
and £5 more on each of three editions, of which Milton received
£10, and his widow £8, the rest being unpaid. In English literature
"Paradise Lost" stands alone as an effort of sheer imagination,
and its literary genius is as haunting as its conception
is stupendous.</p>

them that the time seems approaching when
they "must bide the stroke of that long-threatened wound,"
when "the woman's Seed shall bruise the serpent's head." They
agree that Satan shall return to earth and act as Tempter. In
Heaven, meantime, God tells the assembly of angels, addressing
Gabriel, that He will expose His Son to Satan, in order that
the Son may "show him worthy of His birth divine and high
prediction." And the angelic choir sings "Victory and triumph

<p><a name="Footnote_AB_28" id="Footnote_AB_28"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AB_28"><span class="label">[AB]</span></a> The origin of "Paradise Regained" has been told authentically.
It was suggested in 1665 by Ellwood the Quaker, who
sometimes acted as Milton's amanuensis, and it was finished and
shown to Ellwood in 1666, though not published till 1671.
Neither in majesty of conception or in charm of style can it
compare with "Paradise Lost," to which it is, as has been said,
a codicil and not a sequel. The Temptation, the reader feels,
was but an incident in the life of Christ and in the drama of
the "ways of God to man," which "Paradise Lost" introduced
with such stupendous imaginative power. Much of the poem
is but a somewhat ambling paraphrase and expansion of Scriptural
narratives; but there are passages where Milton resumes
his perfect mastery of poetic form, under the inspiration that
places him among the selectest band of immortal singers.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Samson:</span> A little onward send thy guiding hand<br />
To these dark steps, a little further on;<br />
For yonder bank hath choice of sun or shade.<br />
There I am wont to sit, when any chance<br />
Relieves me from my task of servile toil.<br />
Daily in the common prison else enjoined me,<br />
Where I, a prisoner chained, scarce freely draw<br />
The air, imprisoned also, close and damp,<br />
Unwholesome draught. But here I feel amends<br />
The breath of Heaven fresh blowing, pure and sweet,<br />
With day-spring born; here leave me to respire.<br />
This day a solemn feast the people hold<br />
To Dagon, their sea-idol, and forbid<br />
Laborious works. Hence, with leave<br />
Retiring from the popular noise, I seek<br />
This unfrequented place to find some ease&mdash;<br />
Oh, wherefore was my birth from Heaven foretold<br />
Twice by an angel, if I must die<br />
Betrayed, captive, and both my eyes put out,<br />
Made of my enemies the scorn and gaze?<br />
<br />
O worse than chains,<br />
Dungeon, or beggary, or decrepit age!<br />
Light, the prime work of God, to me is extinct,<br />
And all her various objects of delight<br />
Annulled, which might in part my grief have eased.<br />
O dark, dark, dark, amid the blaze of noon,<br />
Irrevocably dark, total eclipse<br />
Without all hope of day!<br />
O first created beam, and thou great Word,<br />
"Let there be light, and light was over all,"<br />

As one past hope, abandoned.<br />
Which shall I fast bewail&mdash;<br />

Me overthrown, to enter lists with God.<br />
Dagon must stoop, and shall ere long receive<br />

And with confusion blank his worshippers.</p>

To something extraordinary my thoughts.<br />
I with this messenger will go along&mdash;<br />
If there be aught of presage in the mind,<br />
This day will be remarkable in my life<br />
By some great act, or of my days the last.</p>

And hamper thee, as thou shalt come of force,<br />
Though thou wert firmlier fastened than a rock.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Officer:</span> I praise thy resolution. Doff these links:<br />
By this compliance thou wilt win the lords<br />
To favour, and perhaps to set thee free.</p>

I will not wish, lest it perhaps offend them<br />
To see me girt with friends.<br />
Happen what may, of me expect to hear<br />
Nothing dishonourable, impure, unworthy<br />
Our God, our Law, my nation, or myself.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Chorus:</span> Go, and the Holy One<br />
Of Israel be thy guide.</p>

Was not at present here to find my son.<br />

By order of the lords new parted hence<br />
To come and play before them at their feast.<br />
I heard all as I came; I had no will,<br />
Lest I should see him forced to things unseemly.<br />
But that which moved my coming now was chiefly<br />
To give ye part with me what hope I have<br />
With good success to work his liberty.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Chorus:</span> That hope would much rejoice us to partake<br />
With thee.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Manoa:</span> What noise or shout was that? It tore the sky.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Chorus:</span> Doubtless the people shouting to behold<br />
Their once great dread, captive and blind before them,<br />
Or at some proof of strength, before them shown.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Manoa:</span> His ransom, if my whole inheritance<br />
May compass it, shall willingly be paid<br />
And numbered down. Much rather I shall choose<br />
To live the poorest in my tribe, than richest,<br />
And he in that calamitous prison left.<br />
No, I am fixed not to part hence without him.<br />
For his redemption all my patrimony,<br />
If need be, I am ready to forego<br />
And quit. Not wanting him, I shall want nothing.<br />
It shall be my delight to tend his eyes,<br />
And view him sitting in his house, ennobled<br />
With all those high exploits by him achieved.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Chorus:</span> Thy hopes are not ill founded, nor seem vain,<br />
Of his delivery.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Manoa:</span> I know your friendly minds, and&mdash;O what noise!<br />
Mercy of Heaven! What hideous noise was that<br />
Horribly loud, unlike the former shout.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Chorus:</span> Noise call you it, or universal groan,<br />
As if the whole inhabitation perished?<br />
Blood, death, and deathful deeds, are in that noise,<br />
Ruin, destruction at the utmost point.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Manoa:</span> Of ruin indeed methought I heard the noise.<br />
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
Oh! it continues; the have slain my son.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Chorus:</span> Thy son is rather slaying them; that outcry<br />
From slaughter of one foe could not ascend.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Manoa:</span> Some dismal accident it needs must be.<br />
What shall we do&mdash;stay here, or run and see?</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Chorus:</span> Best keep together here, lest, running thither,<br />
We unawares run into danger's mouth.<br />
This evil on the Philistines is fallen:<br />
From whom could else a general cry be heard?</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Chorus:</span> I see one hither speeding&mdash;<br />
An Hebrew, as I guess, and of our tribe.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Messenger:</span> O, whither shall I run, or which way fly?<br />
The sight of this so horrid spectacle,<br />
Which erst my eyes beheld, and yet behold?</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Manoa:</span> The accident was loud, and here before thee<br />
With rueful cry; yet what it was we know not.<br />
Tell us the sum, the circumstance defer.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Messenger:</span> Gaza yet stands; but all her sons are fallen,<br />
All in a moment overwhelmed and fallen.</p>

The desolation of a hostile city.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Messenger:</span> Feed on that first; there may in grief be surfeit.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Manoa:</span> Relate by whom.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Messenger:</span> By Samson.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Manoa:</span> That still lessens<br />
The sorrow and converts it nigh to joy.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Messenger:</span> Ah! Manoa, I refrain too suddenly<br />
To utter what will come at last too soon,<br />
Lest evil tidings, with too rude eruption<br />
Hitting thy aged ear, should pierce too deep.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Manoa:</span> Suspense in news is torture; speak them out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span></p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Messenger:</span> Then take the worst in brief&mdash;Samson is dead.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Manoa:</span> The worst indeed! O, all my hope's defeated<br />
To free him hence! but Death, who sets all free,<br />
Hath paid his ransom now and full discharge.<br />
How died he?&mdash;death to life is crown or shame.<br />
All by him fell, thou say'st; by whom fell he?<br />
What glorious hand gave Samson his death's wound?</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Messenger:</span> Unwounded of his enemies he fell.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Manoa:</span> Wearied with slaughter, then, or how? Explain.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Messenger:</span> By his own hands.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Manoa:</span> Self-violence! What cause<br />
Brought him so soon at variance with himself<br />
Among his foes?</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Messenger:</span> Inevitable cause&mdash;<br />
At once both to destroy and be destroyed.<br />
The edifice, where all were met to see him,<br />
Upon their heads and on his own he pulled.<br />
The building was a spacious theatre,<br />
Half round on two main pillars vaulted high,<br />
With seats where all the lords, and each degree<br />
Of sort, might sit in order to behold.<br />
<br />
Immediately<br />
Was Samson as a public servant brought,<br />
In their state livery clad.<br />
At sight of him the people with a shout<br />
Rifted the air, clamoring their god with praise,<br />
Who had made their dreadful enemy their thrall.<br />
He patient, but undaunted, where they led him,<br />
Came to the place; and what was set before him,<br />
Which without help of eye might be assayed,<br />
To heave, pull, draw, or break, he still performed<br />
All with incredible, stupendous force,<br />
None daring to appear antagonist<br />
At length, for intermission sake, they led him<br />
Between the pillars; he his guide requested,<br />
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
As over-tired, to let him lean awhile<br />
With both his arms on those two massy pillars,<br />
That to the arched roof gave main support.<br />
He unsuspicious led him; which when Samson<br />
Felt in his arms, with head awhile inclined,<br />
And eyes fast fixed, he stood, as one who prayed,<br />
Or some great matter in his mind revolved.<br />
At last, with head erect, thus cried aloud,<br />
"Hitherto, lords, what your commands imposed<br />
I have performed, as reason was, obeying,<br />
Not without wonder or delight beheld;<br />
Now, of my own accord, such other trial<br />
I mean to show you of my strength yet greater<br />
As with amaze shall strike all who behold."<br />
This uttered, straightening all his nerves, he bowed.<br />
As with the force of winds and waters pent<br />
When mountains tremble, those two massy pillars<br />
With horrible convulsions to and fro<br />
He tugged, he shook, till down they came, and drew<br />
The whole roof after them with burst of thunder<br />
Upon the heads of all who sat beneath,<br />
Lords, ladies, captains, counsellors, or priests,<br />
Their choice nobility and flower, not only<br />
Of this, but each Philistian city round,<br />
Met from all parts to solemnise this feast.<br />
Samson, with these immixed, inevitably<br />
Pulled down the same destruction on himself;<br />
The vulgar only scaped, who stood without.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Manoa:</span> Samson hath quit himself<br />
Like Samson, and heroically hath finished<br />
A life heroic.<br />
Nothing is here for tears, nothing to wail<br />
Or knock the breast; no weakness, no contempt,<br />
Dispraise or blame; nothing but well and fair,<br />
And what may quiet us in a death so noble.<br />
Let us go find the body where it lies.<br />
<br />
I, with what speed the while<br />
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
Will send for all my kindred, all my friends,<br />
To fetch him hence, and solemnly attend,<br />
With silent obsequy and funeral train,<br />
Home to his father's house. There will I build him<br />
A monument, and plant it round with shade<br />
Of laurel evergreen and branching palm,<br />
With all his trophies hung, and acts enrolled<br />
In copious legend, or sweet lyric song.<br />
Thither shall all the valiant youth resort,<br />
And from his memory inflame their breasts<br />
To matchless valour and adventures high.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_AC_29" id="Footnote_AC_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AC_29"><span class="label">[AC]</span></a> "Samson Agonistes" (that is, "Samson the Athlete, or
Wrestler"), Milton's tragedy, cast in a classical mould, was
composed after "Paradise Regained" was written, and after
"Paradise Lost" was published. It was issued in 1671. No
reader with knowledge can avoid associating the poem in a
personal way with Milton, who, like Samson, was blind, living
in the midst of enemies, and to some extent deserted; and, like
him too, did not lose heart on behalf of the life's cause which,
unlike Samson, he had never betrayed. As becomes a drama,
it has more vigorously sustained movement than any of Milton's
works. The familiar story is skilfully developed and relieved,
and the formality of the style does not detract from the pity
and beauty, while it adds to the dignity of the work.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Act I</span></h3>

<blockquote>
<p class="font09 pmb1">Just when the day has been fixed for the marriage of Lucinde,
daughter of M. Géronte, she suddenly becomes dumb, and no
doctors are found skillful enough to cure her. One day Valère,
M. Géronte's attendant, and Lucas, the nurse, are scouring the
country in search of someone able to restore their young mistress's
speech, when they fell in with Martine, the wife of
Sganarelle, a bibulous faggot-binder. Sganarelle, who has served
a famous doctor for ten years, has just been beating his wife,
and she, in revenge, hearing the kind of person they are looking
for, strongly recommends her husband to them as an eccentric
doctor who has performed wonderful and almost incredible
cures, but who always disclaims his profession, and will
never practice it until he has been well cudgelled. Lucas and
Valère accordingly go in quest of Sganarelle, and, having found
him, express their desire of availing themselves of his services
as doctor. At first the faggot-binder vehemently denies that he
is a doctor, but at last&mdash;thanks to the use of the persuasion
recommended by Martine&mdash;he confesses to a knowledge of the
physician's art, is induced to undertake the cure of Mlle. Lucinde,
and, on being introduced at M. Géronte's house, gives proof of
his eccentricity as a doctor by cudgelling the master and embracing
the nurse.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Géronte:</span> Yes. I have but one daughter; I should
feel inexpressible grief were she to die.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Sganarelle:</span> Don't let her do anything of the kind.
She must not die without a doctor's prescription.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Géronte:</span> You have made her laugh, monsieur.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Sganarelle:</span> It is the best symptom in the world
when the doctor makes his patient laugh. What sort
of pain do you feel?</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Lucinde</span> (<i>replies by signs, putting her hand to her
mouth, to her head, and under her chin</i>): Ha, hi, ho, ha!</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Sganarelle</span> (<i>imitating her</i>): Ha, hi, ho, ha! I don't
understand you.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Géronte:</span> That is what her complaint is, monsieur.
She became dumb, without our being able to find out the
cause. It is this accident which has made us put off the
marriage. The man she is going to marry wishes to wait
till she gets better.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span></p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Sganarelle:</span> Who is the fool that does not want his
wife to be dumb? Would to heaven that mine had that
complaint! I would take good care she did not recover
her speech.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Géronte:</span> Well, monsieur, I beg of you to take all
possible pains to cure her of this illness.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Sganarelle</span> (<i>to the patient</i>): Let me feel your pulse.
This tells me your daughter is dumb.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Géronte:</span> Yes, monsieur, that is just what her illness
is; you have found it out the very first time.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Sganarelle:</span> We great doctors, we know things at
once. An ignorant person would have been puzzled, and
would have said to you: "It is this, it is that." But I
was right the very first time. I tell you your daughter is
dumb.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Géronte:</span> But I should be very pleased if you could
tell me how this happened.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Sganarelle:</span> It is because she has lost her speech.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Géronte:</span> But, please, what was the cause of the loss
of speech?</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Sganarelle:</span> All our best authorities will tell you that
it is an impediment in the action of her tongue.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Géronte:</span> But, nevertheless, let us have your opinion
on this impediment in the action of her tongue.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Sganarelle:</span> I hold that this impediment in the
action of her tongue is caused by certain humours,
which among us learned men are called peccant humours.
For as the vapours formed by the exhalations
of the influences which arise in the region of
complaints, coming&mdash;so to speak&mdash;to&mdash;Do you know
Latin?</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Géronte:</span> In no sort of way.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Sganarelle</span> (<i>rising in astonishment</i>): You don't
know Latin?</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Géronte:</span> No.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Sganarelle</span> (<i>assuming various amusing attitudes</i>):
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
<i>Singulariter, nominativo hæc musa</i>, "the muse," <i>bonus</i>,
<i>bona, bonum, Deus sanctus, estne oratio latenas?

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Géronte:</span> Oh! Why did I not study?</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Jacqueline:</span> What a clever man he is!</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Sganarelle:</span> Thus these vapours of which I speak
passing from the left side, where the liver is, to the right
side where the heart is, it happens that the lungs, which
we call in Latin <i>armyan</i>, having communication with the
brain, which in Greek we name <i>nasmus</i>, by means of the
<i>vena cava</i>, which we call in Hebrew <i>cubile</i>, in their way
meet the said vapours, which fill the ventricles of the
omoplata; and as the said vapours&mdash;be sure you understand
this argument, I beg you&mdash;and as these said vapours
have a certain malignancy&mdash;listen carefully to this,
I pray you.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Géronte:</span> Yes.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Sganarelle:</span> Are gifted with a certain malignancy
which is caused&mdash;please pay attention&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Géronte:</span> I am doing so.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Sganarelle:</span> Which is caused by the acridity of the
humour engendered in the concavity of the diaphragm, it
happens that these vapours&mdash;<i>Ossabundus, nequezs, nequer,
potarinum, quipsa milus</i>. That is just what makes
your daughter dumb.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Géronte:</span> No one, doubtless, could argue better.
There is but one thing that puzzles me. It seems to me
that you place the heart and liver differently from where
they are; the heart is on the left side, and the liver on
the right.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Sganarelle:</span> Yes, that was so formerly; but we have
changed all that, and nowadays we practise medicine by
an entirely new method.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Géronte:</span> I did not know that. I must ask you to
pardon my ignorance.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Sganarelle:</span> There is no harm done. You are not
obliged to be as clever as we are.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span></p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Géronte:</span> Certainly not. But what do you think,
monsieur, ought to be done for this complaint?</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Sganarelle:</span> My advice is that she should be put to
bed, and, for a remedy, you must see that she takes plenty
of bread soaked in wine.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Géronte:</span> Why so, monsieur?</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Sganarelle:</span> Because in bread and wine mixed together
there is a sympathetic virtue which causes speech.
Don't you know that they give nothing else to parrots,
and that they learn to speak by being fed on this diet?</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Géronte:</span> That is true. What a great man you are!
Quick, bring plenty of bread and wine.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Sganarelle:</span> I shall come back at night to see how
she is getting on.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Géronte:</span> Just wait a moment, please.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Sganarelle:</span> What do you want?</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Géronte:</span> To give you your fee, monsieur.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Sganarelle</span> (<i>holding out his hand from under his
gown, while Géronte opens his purse</i>): I shall not take it,
monsieur.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Géronte:</span> I beseech you.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Sganarelle:</span> You are jesting.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Géronte:</span> That is settled.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Sganarelle:</span> I will not.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Géronte:</span> What!</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Sganarelle:</span> I don't practise for money.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Géronte:</span> I am sure you don't.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Sganarelle</span> (<i>after having taken the money</i>): Is it
good weight?</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Géronte:</span> Yes, monsieur.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Sganarelle:</span> I am not a mercenary doctor.</p>

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Géronte:</span> I know that.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Act II</span></h3>

<blockquote>
<p class="font09 pmb1">Léandre, between whom and Lucinde a mutual attachment
subsists, has an interview with Sganarelle, at which he implores
the latter's assistance to obtain a meeting with his mistress,
and tells him that her dumbness is a mere trick&mdash;a sham illness
which she has feigned to free herself from a distasteful marriage
into which her father wants to hurry her. In consideration
of a purse of gold which Léandre gives him, Sganarelle
introduces the young lover into M. Géronte's house as his apothecary,
and when Léandre asks whether it is not necessary to
know five or six long medical words with which to lard his
conversation, ridicules the notion, and says that a medical dress
is quite sufficient disguise. "I am resolved to stick to physic
all my life," says Sganarelle. "I find that it is the best line of
all; for whatever we do, right or wrong, we are paid, all the
same. Blunders make no odds to us; we cut away the material
we have to work with as we choose. A shoemaker, in making
a pair of shoes, cannot spoil a scrap of leather without having

<p class="it1"><span class="smcap">Sganarelle:</span> Yes; let me manage it. I have remedies
for everything, and our apothecary is the man for
this cure. (<i>He calls the apothecary, and speaks to him</i>.)
You see that the passion she has for this Léandre is quite
against the wishes of her father, and that it is necessary
to find a prompt remedy for the evil, which will only
become worse by delay. For my part, I see but one
remedy, a dose of purgative flight suitably mixed with
two drachms of matrimony in pills. Go and take a little
turn in the garden with her to prepare the humours,
while I talk here with her father; but, above all, lose
no time. Apply the remedy at once&mdash;apply the specific
remedy.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_AD_30" id="Footnote_AD_30"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AD_30"><span class="label">[AD]</span></a> Molière, whose real name was Jean Baptiste Poquelin, the
name Molière not having been assumed until he had commenced
authorship, was born at Paris, January 15, 1622. Almost nothing
is known of his early life, except that in his fourteenth year
he was sent to the Jesuit Collège de Clermont, in Paris, and that
later he studied law. In 1645 he suddenly appeared upon the
stage as a member of a company of strolling players, and later,
through the recommendation of influential friends, his company
gained permission to act before the King. His comedies soon
placed him in the front rank of French dramatists, and he is
now regarded as perhaps the greatest of all comic dramatists.
Of all the learned classes that fell under Molière's merciless
lash, none came so completely as the profession of medicine.
This is especially the case in "The Doctor in Spite of Himself"
("Lie Médecin Malgré Lui"), which appeared in June,
1666, and in which Molière himself played the role of Sganarelle.
</p>
<p>
The piece was originally acted with the "Misanthrope," but its
immediate and pronounced success justified its being put on the
bill alone. Both in conception and in motive the "Doctor" is
frankly farcical, yet the lines abound in delicious satire, and on
occasions melt from sheer buffoonery into graceful comedy.
Molière died on February 17, 1673.</p>
